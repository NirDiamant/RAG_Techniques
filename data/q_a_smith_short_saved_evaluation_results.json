    "The author of 'The Wealth of Nations' is Adam Smith.",
    "The provided context does not contain a specific definition of the 'invisible hand.' It discusses the concept in relation to individuals pursuing their own interests and how this can inadvertently promote the interests of society, but it does not explicitly define the term.",
    "The three factors of production mentioned are wages, profits, and rent.",
    "Labor plays a crucial role in determining the value of goods as it is considered the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities. The value of a commodity to a person is equal to the quantity of labor it enables them to purchase or command. Labor is the original price paid for all things, and the real price of goods is ultimately based on the toil and trouble involved in acquiring them. While money represents a nominal price, the true value of commodities is assessed in terms of the labor required to produce or obtain them.",
    "Adam Smith connects self-interest to the broader good of society by arguing that individual pursuits of interest often lead to outcomes that benefit society as a whole. He suggests that when individuals seek to improve their own conditions, they inadvertently promote the general interest of society. For instance, the competition among traders and artisans to regulate their markets can lead to a more efficient allocation of resources, which ultimately benefits everyone. Additionally, improvements in the circumstances of the lower ranks of society are seen as advantageous to the whole, as a flourishing society cannot thrive if the majority are poor and miserable. Thus, self-interest and societal good are interconnected, with the former often leading to the latter.",
    "Smith justifies the need for taxation by stating that a government requires revenue to support its necessary expenses. He emphasizes that when proper subjects of taxation are exhausted, governments may resort to improper ones in cases of urgent necessity. He also notes that a well-structured tax system should minimize the burden on the people while ensuring that the revenue collected is sufficient for the state's needs. Additionally, he argues that taxes should be certain, convenient, and equitable to avoid undue hardship on contributors.",
    "The relationship between supply and demand in determining prices is that the market price of a commodity is regulated by the quantity brought to market in relation to the effectual demand of those willing to pay its natural price. When the quantity supplied falls short of effectual demand, competition among buyers drives the market price above the natural price. Conversely, if the quantity exceeds effectual demand, the market price will drop below the natural price due to competition among sellers. Thus, prices fluctuate based on the balance between supply and demand.",
    "The division of labor contributes to innovation by allowing individuals to specialize in specific tasks, which enhances their skill, dexterity, and judgment. This specialization leads to increased productivity and the invention of new machinery and methods, as more minds focus on improving specific operations. The long-term economic impacts include a significant increase in the productive powers of labor, resulting in greater overall production and universal opulence in society, benefiting even the lowest ranks of people. This process fosters a commercial society where individuals exchange surplus goods, further driving economic growth and efficiency.",
    "Smith views agriculture as the most significant contributor to economic wealth, emphasizing that it produces a greater quantity of food and adds more value to the annual produce of land and labor compared to manufacturing. He argues that agriculture is capable of absorbing more capital and generates a more substantial reproduction of value due to the natural fertility of the land working alongside human labor. In contrast, while manufacturing also contributes to wealth, it does not match the productivity and value addition of agriculture. Smith suggests that the order of capital investment typically flows from agriculture to manufacturing, indicating agriculture's foundational role in economic development.",
    "Foreign trade enhances domestic wealth by opening up larger markets for surplus produce, allowing for greater division of labor and increased productive power. It encourages improvements in industry and augments the annual produce of a country, thereby increasing real revenue and wealth. This aligns with Smith's idea of the 'invisible hand,' as individuals, motivated by their own profit, naturally direct their capital towards endeavors that support domestic industry and maximize the value of their produce, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.",
    "Capital accumulation leads to economic growth by enabling the employment of more laborers and facilitating the division of labor. As stock is accumulated, it allows for a greater distribution of employment among workers, which increases their productivity. This, in turn, leads to the invention of better machinery and methods, enhancing the productive powers of labor. The increase in capital stock correlates with a rise in the demand for labor, resulting in a more efficient allocation of resources and a greater output of work. Thus, capital accumulation not only supports economic growth but also promotes a more refined division of labor, allowing for increased specialization and efficiency in production.",
    "The challenges of trade include:\n\n1. **Public Prejudices and Private Interests**: There are strong public prejudices and private interests that oppose the restoration of free trade, making it difficult to achieve.\n\n2. **Monopolies and Regulations**: The mercantile system introduces dangerous disorders into the economy, with monopolies forcing capital away from more beneficial trades and creating inefficiencies.\n\n3. **National Prejudice and Animosity**: Trade is often hindered by national prejudices and animosities, leading to discord rather than cooperation among trading nations.\n\n4. **Obstruction of Communication**: Geographic limitations, such as the lack of navigable rivers and seas in certain regions, can obstruct trade and communication.\n\n5. **Economic Disruption**: Sudden changes in trade regulations can lead to significant economic distress and disorder, particularly for manufacturers reliant on specific markets.\n\n6. **Competition and Profit Rates**: The monopoly of certain trades can keep profit rates artificially high, reducing competition and leading to relative disadvantages in other branches of trade.\n\nThese challenges create a complex environment for trade that can lead to inefficiencies and conflicts.",
    "The book defines value in two ways: 'value in use,' which expresses the utility of an object, and 'value in exchange,' which refers to the power of purchasing other goods that the possession of that object conveys. The exchangeable value of a commodity is equal to the quantity of labor it enables one to purchase or command, making labor the real measure of exchangeable value.",
    "Smith views the role of government in the economy as minimal, advocating for the freedom of trade without government intervention. He believes that the market naturally regulates itself according to demand and that government regulations often disrupt this balance, ultimately hindering economic growth and the interests of consumers.",
    "In Chapter 2, the key arguments made about the benefits of free trade include:\n\n1. **Market Expansion**: Free trade allows for a greater market for surplus produce, encouraging increased production and improving the overall wealth of society.\n\n2. **Price Reduction**: It leads to lower prices for consumers by allowing access to cheaper foreign goods, which benefits the economy by reducing costs for all classes.\n\n3. **Encouragement of Industry**: The competition from foreign goods can stimulate domestic industries to improve and innovate, enhancing productivity.\n\n4. **Reciprocal Gains**: Both trading nations benefit mutually, as trade does not result in a loss for one country but rather increases the overall wealth and enjoyment of both.\n\n5. **Avoidance of Monopolies**: Free trade prevents monopolistic practices that can arise from high duties and prohibitions, which can harm the economy by raising prices and limiting choices.\n\n6. **Economic Resilience**: By allowing for the importation of goods, countries can better manage shortages and economic fluctuations, thus preventing crises like famine.\n\nThese arguments collectively highlight the importance of free trade in fostering economic growth, improving living standards, and enhancing the efficiency of industries."

It appears to him dear in the one\ncase, and cheap in the other .

Though the money price of labour , therefore, is\nsometimes high where the price of provisions is low, it would be\nstill higher , the demand continuing the same, if the price of\nprovisions was high.\nIt is because the demand for labour increases in years of sudden\nand extraordinary plenty , and diminishes in those of sudden and\nextraordinary scarcity , that the money price of labour sometimes\nrises in the one, and sinks in the other .",

      "CHAPTER I.\nOF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.\nThe greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour ,\nand the greater part of the skill, dexterity , and judgment, with\nwhich it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the\neffects of the division of labour . The effects of the division of\nlabour , in the general business of society , will be more easily\nunderstood, by considering in what manner it operates in some\nparticular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be carried\nfurthest in some very triÔ¨Çing ones; not perhaps that it really is\ncarried further in them than in others of more importance: but in\nthose triÔ¨Çing manufactures which are destined to supply the small\nwants of but a small number of peop le, the whole number of\nworkmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\ndifferent branch of the work can often be collected into the same\nworkhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator .",

The division of\nlabour , however , so far as it can be introduced, occasions, in every\nart, a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labour .\nThe separation of different trades and employments from one\nanother , seems to have taken place in consequence of this\nadvantage. This separation, too, is generally carried furthest in\nthose countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and\nimprovement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of\nsociety , being generally that of several in an improved one. In\nevery improved society , the farmer is generally nothing but a",

Each individual\nbecomes more expert in his own peculiar branch, more work is\ndone upon the whole, and the quantity of science is considerably\nincreased by it.\nIt is the great multiplication of the productions of all the\ndifferent arts, in consequence of the division of labour , which\noccasions, in a well-governed society , that universal opulence\nwhich extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every\nworkman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of\nbeyond what he himself has occasi on for; and every other\nworkman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to\nexchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or,\nwhat comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of\ntheirs.

      "CHAPTER II.\nOF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH\nGIVES OCCASION TO THE\nDIVISION OF LABOUR.\nThis division of labour , from which so many advantages are\nderived, is not originally the effect of any human wisdom, which\nforesees and intends that general opulence to which it gives\noccasion. It is the necessary , though very slow and gradual,\nconsequence of a certain propensity in human nature, which has in\nview no such extensive utility; the propensity to truck, barter , and\nexchange one thing for another .\nWhether this propensity be one of those original principles in\nhuman nature, of which no further account can be given, or\nwhether , as seems more probable, it be the necessary consequence\nof the faculties of reason and speech, it belongs not to our present\nsubject to inquire. It is common to all men, and to be found in no\nother race of animals, which seem to know neither this nor any\nother species of contracts. Two greyho unds, in running down the",
      "CHAPTER IV .\nOF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF\nMONEY .\nWhen the division of labour has been once thoroughly\nestablished, it is but a very small part of a man‚Äô s wants which the\nproduce of his own labour can supply . He supplies the far greater\npart of them by exchanging that surplus part of the produce of his\nown labour , which is over and above his own consumption, for\nsuch parts of the produce of other men‚Äô s labour as he has occasion\nfor. Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes, in some\nmeasure, a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is\nproperly a commercial society .\nBut when the division of labour Ô¨Årst began to take place, this\npower of exchanging must frequently have been very much\nclogged and embarrassed in its operations. One man, we shall\nsuppose, has more of a certain commodity than he himself has\noccasion for, while another has less. The former , consequently ,\nwould be glad to dispose of; and the latter to purchase, a part of",

The funds destined for the\nmaintenance of productive labour are not only much greater in the\nformer than in the latter , but bear a much greater proportion to\nthose which, though they may be employed to maintain either\nproductive or unproductive hands, have generally a predilection for\nthe latter .\nThe proportion between those different funds necessarily\ndetermines in every country the general character of the inhabitants\nas to industry or idleness. We are more industrious than our\nforefathers, because, in the present times, the funds destined for the\nmaintenance of industry are much greater in proportion to those\nwhich are likely to be employed in the maintenance of idleness,\nthan they were two or three centuries ago. Our ancestors were idle",
      "abundance or scantiness of its annual supply must depend, during\nthe continuance of that state, upon the proportion between the\nnumber of those who are annually employed in useful labour , and\nthat of those who are not so employed.  The number of useful and\nproductive labourers, it will hereafter appear , is everywhere in\nproportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in\nsetting them to work, and to the particular way in which it is so\nemployed. The second book, therefore, treats of the nature of\ncapital stock, of the manner in which it is gradually accumulated,\nand of the different quantities of labour which it puts into motion,\naccording to the dif ferent ways in which it is employed.\nNations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity , and\njudgment, in the application of labour , have followed very different\nplans in the general conduct or direction of it; and those plans have\nnot all been equally favourable to the greatness of its produce. The",
      "productive labour , the notions which it inculcates are, perhaps, too\nnarrow and conÔ¨Åned; yet in representing the wealth of nations as\nconsisting, not in the unconsumable riches of money , but in the\nconsumable goods annually reproduced by the labour of the\nsociety , and in representing perfect liberty as the only effectual\nexpedient for rendering this annual reproduction the greatest\npossible, its doctrine seems to be in every respect as just as it is\ngenerous and liberal. Its followers are very numerous; and as men\nare fond of paradoxes, and of appearing to understand what\nsurpasses the comprehensions of ordinary people, the paradox\nwhich it maintains, concerning the unproductive nature of\nmanufacturing labour , has not, perhaps, contributed a little to\nincrease the number of its admirers. They have for some years past\nmade a pretty considerable sect, distinguished in the French\nrepublic of letters by the name of the Economists. Their works",

Farmers and\ncountry labourers, indeed, over and above the stock which\nmaintains and employs them, reproduce annually a neat produce, a\nfree rent to the landlord. As a marriage which affords three\nchildren is certainly more productive than one which affords only\ntwo, so the labour of farmers and country labourers is certainly\nmore productive than that of merchants, artiÔ¨Åcers, and\nmanufacturers. The superior produce of the one class, however ,\ndoes not, render the other barren or unproductive.\nSecondly , it seems, on this account, altogether improper to\nconsider artiÔ¨Åcers, manufacturers, and merchants, in the same light\nas menial servants. The labour of menial servants does not\ncontinue the existence of the fund which maintains and employs\nthem. Their maintenance and employment is altogether at the\nexpense of their masters, and the work which they perform is not\nof a nature to repay that expense. That work consists in services",
      "even the common workman, if his wages are considerable, may\nmaintain a menial servant; or he may sometimes go to a play or a\npuppet-show , and so contribute his share towards maintaining one\nset of unproductive labourers; or he may pay some taxes, and thus\nhelp to maintain another set, more honourable and useful, indeed,\nbut equally unproductive. No part of the annual produce, however ,\nwhich had been originally destined to replace a capital, is ever\ndirected towards maintaining unproductive hands, till after it has\nput into motion its full complement of productive labour , or all that\nit could put into motion in the way in which it was employed. The\nworkman must have earned his wages by work done, before he can\nemploy any part of them in this manner . That part, too, is generally\nbut a small one.

The former as it produces a value, may be called productive,\nthe latter , unproductive labour . {Some French authors of great\nlearning and ingenuity have used those words in a different sense.\nIn the last chapter of the fourth book, I shall endeavour to shew\nthat their sense is an improper one.} Thus the labour of a\nmanufacturer adds generally to the value of the materials which he\nworks upon, that of his own maintenance, and of his master ‚Äôs\nproÔ¨Åt. The labour of a menial servant, on the contrary , adds to the\nvalue of nothing.

The whole capital of the undertaker of every work is\nnecessarily divided between his Ô¨Åxed and his circulating capital.\nWhile his whole capital remains the same, the smaller the one part,\nthe greater must necessarily be the other . It is the circulating\ncapital which furnishes the materials and wages of labour , and puts\nindustry into motion.

It is unnecessary to give any example. I shall only\nobserve, therefore, that the invention of all those machines by\nwhich labour is so much facilitated and abridged, seems to have\nbeen originally owing to the division of labour .

For the same\nreason, he endeavours to supply them with the best machinery\nwhich either he or they can think of. What takes place among the\nlabourers in a particular workhouse, takes place, for the same\nreason, among those of a great society .

When the market is very small, no person can\nhave any encouragement to dedicate himself entirely to one\nemployment, for want of the power to exchange all that surplus\npart of the produce of his own labour , which is over and above his\nown consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men‚Äô s\nlabour as he has occasion for .\nThere are some sorts of industry , even of the lowest kind, which\ncan be carried on nowhere but in a great town.

To attempt, however , prematurely , and\nwith an insufÔ¨Åcient capital, to do all the three, is certainly not the\nshortest way for a society , no more than it would be for an\nindividual, to acquire a sufÔ¨Åcient one. The capital of all the\nindividuals of a nation has its limits, in the same manner as that of\na single individual, and is capable of executing only certain\npurposes. The capital of all the individuals of a nation is increased\nin the same manner as that of a single individual, by their\ncontinually accumulating and adding to it whatever they save out\nof their revenue.

The labour of a menial servant, on the contrary , adds to the\nvalue of nothing. Though the manufacturer has his wages\nadvanced to him by his master , he in reality costs him no expense,\nthe value of those wages being generally restored, together with a\nproÔ¨Åt, in the improved value of the subject upon which his labour",

In the Ô¨Årst chapter ,\nI have endeavoured to shew what are the different parts or\nbranches into which the stock, either of an individual, or of a great\nsociety , naturally divides itself. In the second, I have endeavoured\nto explain the nature and operation of money , considered as a\nparticular branch of the general stock of the society . The stock\nwhich is accumulated into a capital, may either be employed by the\nperson to whom it belongs, or it may be lent to some other person.\nIn the third and fourth chapters, I have endeavoured to examine the\nmanner in which it operates in both these situations. The Ô¨Åfth and\nlast chapter treats of the different effects which the different\nemployments of capital immediately produce upon the quantity ,\nboth of national industry , and of the annual produce of land and\nlabour .1/25/25, 7:29 PM The Wealth of Nations | Project Gutenberg",
      "CHAPTER I.\nOF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.\nThe greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour ,\nand the greater part of the skill, dexterity , and judgment, with\nwhich it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the\neffects of the division of labour . The effects of the division of\nlabour , in the general business of society , will be more easily\nunderstood, by considering in what manner it operates in some\nparticular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be carried\nfurthest in some very triÔ¨Çing ones; not perhaps that it really is\ncarried further in them than in others of more importance: but in\nthose triÔ¨Çing manufactures which are destined to supply the small\nwants of but a small number of peop le, the whole number of\nworkmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\ndifferent branch of the work can often be collected into the same\nworkhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator ."

In those other branches of trade, it\nhas diminished the competition of British capitals, and thereby\nraised the rate of British proÔ¨Åt higher than it otherwise would have\nbeen.

In\nconsequence of its being the instrument of commerce, when we\nhave money we can more readily obtain whatever else we have\noccasion for, than by means of any other commodity . The great\naffair, we always Ô¨Ånd, is to get money . When that is obtained, there\nis no difÔ¨Åculty in making any subsequent purchase. In\nconsequence of its being the measure of value, we estimate that of\nall other commodities by the quantity of money which they will\nexchange for. We say of a rich man, that he is worth a great deal,\nand of a poor man, that he is worth very little money . A frugal man,\nor a man eager to be rich, is said to love money; and a careless, a\ngenerous, or a profuse man, is said to be indifferent about it. To",

Money , therefore, necessarily runs after goods,\nbut goods do not always or necessarily run after money . The man\nwho buys, does not always mean to sell again, but frequently to\nuse or to consume; whereas he who sells always means to buy\nagain. The one may frequently have done the whole, but the other\ncan never have done more than the one half of his business.

It was not by gold or\nby silver , but by labour , that all the wealth of the world was\noriginally purchased; and its value, to those who possess it, and\nwho want to exchange it for some new productions, is precisely\nequal to the quantity of labour which it can enable them to\npurchase or command.\nWealth, as Mr Hobbes says, is power . But the person who either\nacquires, or succeeds to a great fortune, does not necessarily\nacquire or succeed to any political power , either civil or military .\nHis fortune may, perhaps, afford him the means of acquiring both;\nbut the mere possession of that fortune does not necessarily convey\nto him either .

The quantity of circulating money must have borne\nthe same proportion, to the number and value of purchases and\nsales usually transacted at that time,  which it does to those\ntransacted at present; or, rather , it must have borne a greater\nproportion, because there was then no paper , which now occupies a\ngreat part of the employment of gold and silver .

But no commodities regulate themselves more easily or\nmore exactly , according to this effectual demand, than gold and\nsilver; because, on account of the small bulk and great value of\nthose metals, no commodities can be more easily transported from\none place to another; from the places where they are cheap, to",

If, on the contrary , in any\nparticular country , their quantity fell short of the effectual demand,\nso as to raise their price above that of the neighbouring countries,\nthe government would have no occasion to take any pains to\nimport them. If it were even to take pains to prevent their\nimportation, it would not be able to effectuate it.

      "After all the anxiety , however , which they have excited about this,\nafter all the vain attempts of almost all trading nations to turn that\nbalance in their own favour , and against their neighbours, it does\nnot appear that any one nation in Europe has been, in any respect,\nimpoverished by this cause. Every town and country , on the\ncontrary , in proportion as they have opened their ports to all\nnations, instead of being ruined by this free trade, as the principles\nof the commercial system would lead us to expect, have been\nenriched by it. Though there are in Europe indeed, a few towns\nwhich, in same respects, deserve the name of free ports, there is no\ncountry which does so. Holland, perhaps , approaches the nearest to\nthis character of any, though still very remote from it; and Holland,\nit is acknowledged, not only derives its whole wealth, but a great\npart of its necessary subsistence, from foreign trade.\nThere is another balance, indeed, which has already been",
      "CHAPTER I.\nOF THE NA TURAL  PROGRESS OF\nOPULENCE.\nThe great commerce of every civilized society is that carried on\nbetween the inhabitants of the town and those of the country . It\nconsists in the exchange of rude for manufactured produce, either\nimmediately , or by the intervention of money , or of some sort of\npaper which represents money . The country supplies the town with\nthe means of subsistence and the materials of manufacture. The\ntown repays this supply , by sending back a part of the\nmanufactured produce to the inhabitants of the country . The town,\nin which there neither is nor can be any reproduction of\nsubstances, may very properly be said to gain its whole wealth and\nsubsistence from the country . We must not, however , upon this\naccount, imagine that the gain of the town is the loss of the\ncountry . The gains of both are mutual and reciprocal, and the\ndivision of labour is in this, as in all other cases, advantageous to",
      "account, imagine that the gain of the town is the loss of the\ncountry . The gains of both are mutual and reciprocal, and the\ndivision of labour is in this, as in all other cases, advantageous to\nall the different persons employed in the various occupations into\nwhich it is subdivided. The inhabitants of the country purchase of\nthe town a greater quantity of manufactured goods with the\nproduce of a much smaller quantity of their own labour , than they\nmust have employed had they attempted to prepare them\nthemselves. The town affords a market for the surplus produce of\nthe country , or what is over and abov e the maintenance of the\ncultivators; and it is there that the inhabitants of the country\nexchange it for something else which is in demand among them.\nThe greater the number and revenue of the inhabitants of the town,\nthe more extensive is the market which it affords to those of the\ncountry; and the more extensive that market, it is always the more",
      "procure to them; yet, even upon this supposition, the revenue of a\ntrading and manufacturing country must, other things being equal,\nalways be much greater than that of one without trade or\nmanufactures. By means of trade and manufactures, a greater\nquantity of subsistence can be annually imported into a particular\ncountry , than what its own lands, in the actual state of their\ncultivation, could afford. The inhabitants of a town, though they\nfrequently possess no lands of their own, yet draw to themselves,\nby their industry , such a quantity of the rude produce of the lands\nof other people, as supplies them, not only with the materials of\ntheir work, but with the fund of their subsistence. What a town\nalways is with regard to the country in its neighbourhood, one\nindependent state or country may frequently be with regard to\nother independent states or countries. It is thus that Holland draws\na great part of its subsistence from other countries; live cattle from",
      "the most effectual preventive of a famine; so would the freedom of\nthe exportation and importation trade be among the different states\ninto which a great continent was divided. The larger the continent,\nthe easier the communication through all the different parts of it,\nboth by land and by water , the less would any one particular part of\nit ever be exposed to either of these calamities, the scarcity of any\none country being more likely to be relieved by the plenty of some\nother . But very few countries have entirely adopted this liberal\nsystem. The freedom of the corn trade is almost everywhere more\nor less restrained, and in many countries is conÔ¨Åned by such\nabsurd regulations, as frequently aggravate the unavoidable\nmisfortune of a dearth into the dreadful calamity of a famine. The\ndemand of such countries for corn may frequently become so great\nand so urgent, that a small state in their neighbourhood, which\nhappened at the same time to be labouring under some degree of",
      "above it, foreign corn could have been imported, either duty free,\nor upon paying only a small duty, it might have been exported\nagain, with the beneÔ¨Åt of the bounty , to the great loss of the public\nrevenue, and to the entire perversion of the institution, of which\nthe object was to extend the market for the home growth, not that\nfor the growth of foreign countries.\nIII. The trade of the merchant-export er of corn for foreign\nconsumption, certainly does not contribute directly to the plentiful\nsupply of the home market. It does so, however , indirectly . From\nwhatever source this supply maybe usually drawn, whether from\nhome growth, or from foreign importa tion, unless more corn is\neither usually grown, or usually impor ted into the country , than\nwhat is usually consumed in it, the supp ly of the home market can\nnever be very plentiful. But unless the surplus can, in all ordinary\ncases, be exported, the growers will be careful never to grow more,",
      "When the government, in order to remedy the inconveniencies\nof a dearth, orders all the dealers to sell their corn at what it\nsupposes a reasonable price, it either hinders them from bringing it\nto market, which may sometimes produce a famine even in the\nbeginning of the season; or, if they bring it thither , it enables the\npeople, and thereby encourages them to consume it so fast as must\nnecessarily produce a famine before the end of the season. The\nunlimited, unrestrained freedom of the corn trade, as it is the only\neffectual preventive of the miseries of a famine, so it is the best\npalliative of the inconveniencies of a dearth; for the\ninconveniencies of a real scarcity cannot be remedied; they can\nonly be palliated. No trade deserves more the full protection of the\nlaw, and no trade requires it so much; because no trade is so much\nexposed to popular odium.\nIn years of scarcity , the inferior ranks of people impute their\ndistress to the avarice of the corn merchant, who becomes the",

By the reduction of the army\nand navy at the end of the late war, more  than 100,000 soldiers and\nseamen, a number equal to what is employed in the greatest\nmanufactures, were all at once throw n out of their ordinary\nemployment: but though they no doubt suffered some\ninconveniency , they were not thereby deprived of all employment\nand subsistence.

This may, no doubt, give encouragement to\nsome particular class of workmen among ourselves, and, by\nexcluding some of their rivals, may enable them to raise their price\nin the home market. Those workmen however , who suffered by our\nneighbours prohibition, will not be beneÔ¨Åted by ours. On the\ncontrary , they, and almost all the other classes of our citizens, will\nthereby be obliged to pay dearer than before for certain goods.\nEvery such law, therefore, imposes a real tax upon the whole\ncountry , not in favour of that particular class of workmen who\nwere injured by our neighbours prohibitions, but of some other\nclass.\nThe case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation,\nhow far, or in what manner , it is proper to restore the free\nimportation of foreign goods, after it has been for some time\ninterrupted, is when particular manufactures, by means of high",

      "CHAPTER IV .\nHOW  THE COMMERCE OF\nTOWNS CONTRIBUTED TO THE\nIMPROVEMENT  OF THE\nCOUNTR Y.\nThe increase and riches of commercial and manufacturing towns\ncontributed to the improvement and cultivation of the countries to\nwhich they belonged, in three dif ferent ways.\nFirst, by affording a great and ready market for the rude produce\nof the country , they gave encouragement to its cultivation and\nfurther improvement. This beneÔ¨Åt was not even conÔ¨Åned to the\ncountries in which they were situated, but extended more or less to\nall those with which they had any dealings. To all of them they\nafforded a market for some part either of their rude or\nmanufactured produce, and, consequently , gave some\nencouragement to the industry and impr ovement of all. Their own\ncountry , however , on account of its neighbourhood, necessarily\nderived the greatest beneÔ¨Åt from this market. Its rude produce\nbeing charged with less carriage, the traders could pay the growers",
      "Even the regulations by which each nation endeavours to secure\nto itself the exclusive trade of its own colonies, are frequently\nmore hurtful to the countries in favour of which they are\nestablished, than to those against which  they are established. The\nunjust oppression of the industry of other countries falls back, if I\nmay say so, upon the heads of the oppressors, and crushes their\nindustry more than it does that of those other countries. By those\nregulations, for example, the merchant of Hambur g must send the\nlinen which he destines for the American market to London, and he\nmust bring back from thence the tobacco which he destines for the\nGerman market; because he can neithe r send the one directly to\nAmerica, nor bring the other directly from thence.
