      "Natural gas is the least carbon -intensive fossil fuel and is often seen as a \"bridge fuel\" to a \nlower -carbon future.

Innov ations in fracking \ntechnology have made natural gas more accessible, but this comes with environmental and \nhealth concerns.  \nDeforestation  \nForests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When trees are cut down \nfor timber or to clear land for agriculture, this stored carbon is released back into the \natmosphere. Deforestation reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2, exa cerbating the \ngreenhouse effect.  \nTropical Deforestation  \nTropical rainforests are particularly important for carbon storage.

Improved \nwater management and rice varieties can help reduce these emissions.
