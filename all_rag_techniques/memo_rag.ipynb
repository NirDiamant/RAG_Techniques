    "# MemoRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Memory Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "MemoRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that incorporates a memory model as an auxiliary step before the retrieval phase. In doing so, it bridges the gap in contextual understanding and reasoning that standard RAG techniques face when addressing queries with implicit or ambiguous information needs and unstructured external knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Standard RAG techniques rely heavily on lexical or semantic matching between the query and the knowledge base. While this approach works well for clear question answering tasks with structured knowledge, it often falls short when handling queries with implicit or ambiguous information (e.g., describing the relationships between main characters in a novel) or when the knowledge base is unstructured (e.g., fiction books). In such cases, lexical or semantic matching seldom produces the desired outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. **Memory**: A compressed representation of the database created by a long-context model, designed to handle and summarize extensive inputs efficiently.\n",
    "2. **Retriever**: A standard RAG retrieval model responsible for selecting relevant context from the knowledge base to support the generator.\n",
    "3. **Generator**: A generative language model that produces responses by combining the query with the retrieved context, similar to standard RAG setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "### 1. Memory\n",
    "- The memory module serves as an auxiliary component to enhance the retriever’s ability to identify better matches between queries and relevant parts of the database. It takes the original query and the database as inputs and produces staging answers — intermediate outputs like clues, surrogate queries, or key points — which the retriever uses instead of the original query.\n",
    "- Long-term memory is constructed by running a long-context model, such as Qwen2-7B-Instruct or Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, over the entire database. This process generates a compressed representation of the database through an attention mechanism.\n",
    "- The compressed representation is stored as key-value pairs, facilitating efficient and accurate retrieval.\n",
    "- Released memory models include memorag-qwen2-7b-inst and memorag-mistral-7b-inst, derived from Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Retriever\n",
    "- The retriever is a standard retrieval model, adapted to take processed queries (created by the memory module as staging answers) instead of the original query.\n",
    "- It outputs the retrieved **context**, which serves as the basis for generating the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Generator\n",
    "- The generator produces the final response by combining the retriever’s output (retrieved context) with the original query.\n",
    "- MemoRAG ensures compatibility and consistency by using the memory module’s underlying model as the default generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of the Approach\n",
    "1. **Extended Scope of Queries:** MemoRAG's preprocessing capabilities enable it to handle complex and long-context tasks that conventional RAG methods struggle with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Accuracy:** By simplifying and adjusting queries before retrieval, MemoRAG enhances performance over standard RAG methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility:** Adapts to diverse tasks, datasets, and retrieval scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Robustness:** Improved performance remains consistent across various generators, datasets, and query types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Efficiency**: The use of key-value compression reduces computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The memory module in MemoRAG significantly enhances comprehension of both the queries and the database, enabling more effective retrieval. Its ability to preprocess queries, generate staging answers, and leverage long-context memory models ensures high-quality responses, making MemoRAG a significant step forward in the evolution of retrieval-augmented generation.\n"

Capital stock pays the wages of\\nproductive labour , whether employed in agriculture, manufactures,\\nor commerce. The management of those two original sources of\\nrevenue belongs to two different sets of people; the proprietors of\\nland, and the owners or employers of capital stock.\\nThe proprietor of land is interested, for the sake of his own\\nrevenue, to keep his estate in as good condition as he can, by\\nbuilding and repairing his tenants houses, by making and\\nmaintaining the necessary drains and inclosures, and all those other\\nexpensive improvements which it properly belongs to the landlord\\nto make and maintain. But, by different land taxes, the revenue of\\nthe landlord may be so much diminished, and, by different duties\\nupon the necessaries and conveniencies of life, that diminished\\nrevenue may be rendered of so little real value, that he may ﬁnd', 'Though the whole annual produce of the land and labour of\\nevery country is no doubt ultimately destined for supplying the\\nconsumption of its inhabitants, and for procuring a revenue to\\nthem; yet when it ﬁrst comes either from the ground, or from the\\nhands of the productive labourers, it naturally divides itself into\\ntwo parts. One of them, and frequently the largest, is, in the ﬁrst\\nplace, destined for replacing a capital, or for renewing the\\nprovisions, materials, and ﬁnished work, which had been\\nwithdrawn from a capital; the other for constituting a revenue\\neither to the owner of this capital, as the proﬁt of his stock, or to\\nsome other person, as the rent of his land. Thus, of the produce of\\nland, one part replaces the capital of the farmer; the other pays his\\nproﬁt and the rent of the landlord; and thus constitutes a revenue\\nboth to the owner of this capital, as the proﬁts of his stock, and to\\nsome other person as the rent of his land. Of the produce of a great', 'abundance or scantiness of its annual supply must depend, during\\nthe continuance of that state, upon the proportion between the\\nnumber of those who are annually employed in useful labour , and\\nthat of those who are not so employed.  The number of useful and\\nproductive labourers, it will hereafter appear , is everywhere in\\nproportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in\\nsetting them to work, and to the particular way in which it is so\\nemployed. The second book, therefore, treats of the nature of\\ncapital stock, of the manner in which it is gradually accumulated,\\nand of the different quantities of labour which it puts into motion,\\naccording to the dif ferent ways in which it is employed.\\nNations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity , and\\njudgment, in the application of labour , have followed very different\\nplans in the general conduct or direction of it; and those plans have\\nnot all been equally favourable to the greatness of its produce.

In the ﬁrst chapter ,\\nI have endeavoured to shew what are the different parts or\\nbranches into which the stock, either of an individual, or of a great\\nsociety , naturally divides itself. In the second, I have endeavoured\\nto explain the nature and operation of money , considered as a\\nparticular branch of the general stock of the society . The stock\\nwhich is accumulated into a capital, may either be employed by the\\nperson to whom it belongs, or it may be lent to some other person.\\nIn the third and fourth chapters, I have endeavoured to examine the\\nmanner in which it operates in both these situations. The ﬁfth and\\nlast chapter treats of the different effects which the different\\nemployments of capital immediately produce upon the quantity ,\\nboth of national industry , and of the annual produce of land and\\nlabour .1/25/25, 7:29 PM The Wealth of Nations | Project Gutenberg', 'CHAPTER IX.\\nOF THE AGRICUL TURAL\\nSYSTEMS, OR OF THOSE\\nSYSTEMS OF POLITICAL\\nECONOMY  WHICH REPRESENT\\nTHE PRODUCE OF LAND, AS\\nEITHER THE SOLE OR THE\\nPRINCIP AL SOURCE OF THE\\nREVENUE AND WEAL TH OF\\nEVER Y COUNTR Y.\\nThe agricultural systems of political economy will not require so\\nlong an explanation as that which I have thought it necessary to\\nbestow upon the mercantile or commercial system.\\nThat system which represents the produce of land as the sole\\nsource of the revenue and wealth of every country , has so far as I\\nknow , never been adopted by any nation, and it at present exists\\nonly in the speculations of a few men of great learning and\\ningenuity in France.

But after the division of labour has\\nonce thoroughly taken place, it is but a very small part of these\\nwith which a man’ s own labour can supply him. The far greater\\npart of them he must derive from the labour of other people, and he\\nmust be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labour which\\nhe can command, or which he can afford to purchase. The value of\\nany commodity , therefore, to the person  who possesses it, and who\\nmeans not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for\\nother commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it\\nenables him to purchase or command. Labour therefore, is the real\\nmeasure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.', 'that cheap which is to be had easily , or with very little labour .\\nLabour alone, therefore, never varying in its own value, is alone\\nthe ultimate and real standard by which the value of all\\ncommodities can at all times and places be estimated and\\ncompared. It is their real price; money is their nominal price only .\\nBut though equal quantities of labour are always of equal value\\nto the labourer , yet to the person who employs him they appear\\nsometimes to be of greater , and sometimes of smaller value. He\\npurchases them sometimes with a greater , and sometimes with a\\nsmaller quantity of goods, and to him the price of labour seems to\\nvary like that of all other things. It appears to him dear in the one\\ncase, and cheap in the other . In reality , however , it is the goods\\nwhich are cheap in the one case, and dear in the other .\\nIn this popular sense, therefore, labour , like commodities, may\\nbe said to have a real and a nominal price. Its real price may be', 'which are cheap in the one case, and dear in the other .\\nIn this popular sense, therefore, labour , like commodities, may\\nbe said to have a real and a nominal price. Its real price may be\\nsaid to consist in the quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies\\nof life which are given for it; its nominal price, in the quantity of\\nmoney . The labourer is rich or poor, is well or ill rewarded, in\\nproportion to the real, not to the nominal price of his labour .\\nThe distinction between the real and the nominal price of\\ncommodities and labour is not a matter of mere speculation, but\\nmay sometimes be of considerable use in practice. The same real\\nprice is always of the same value; but on account of the variations\\nin the value of gold and silver , the same nominal price is\\nsometimes of very different values. When a landed estate,\\ntherefore, is sold with a reservation of a perpetual rent, if it is\\nintended that this rent should always be of the same value, it is of', 'life in which price is concerned, we cannot wonder that it should\\nhave been so much more attended to than the real price.\\nIn such a work as this, however , it may sometimes be of use to\\ncompare the different real values of a particular commodity at\\ndifferent times and places, or the different degrees of power over\\nthe labour of other people which it may, upon different occasions,\\nhave given to those who possessed it. We must in this case\\ncompare, not so much the different quantities of silver for which it\\nwas commonly sold, as the different quantities or labour which\\nthose different quantities of silver could have purchased. But the\\ncurrent prices of labour , at distant times and places, can scarce ever\\nbe known with any degree of exactness. Those of corn, though\\nthey have in few places been regularly recorded, are in general\\nbetter known, and have been more frequently taken notice of by\\nhistorians and other writers. We must generally , therefore, content', 'other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it\\nenables him to purchase or command. Labour therefore, is the real\\nmeasure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.\\nThe real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the\\nman who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.\\nWhat every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it\\nand who wants to dispose of it, or exchange it for something else,\\nis the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it\\ncan impose upon other people. What is bought with money , or with\\ngoods, is purchased by labour , as much as what we acquire by the\\ntoil of our own body . That money , or those goods, indeed, save us\\nthis toil. They contain the value of a certain quantity of labour ,\\nwhich we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain the\\nvalue of an equal quantity .
