    "# MemoRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Memory Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "MemoRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that incorporates a memory model as an auxiliary step before the retrieval phase. In doing so, it bridges the gap in contextual understanding and reasoning that standard RAG techniques face when addressing queries with implicit or ambiguous information needs and unstructured external knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Standard RAG techniques rely heavily on lexical or semantic matching between the query and the knowledge base. While this approach works well for clear question answering tasks with structured knowledge, it often falls short when handling queries with implicit or ambiguous information (e.g., describing the relationships between main characters in a novel) or when the knowledge base is unstructured (e.g., fiction books). In such cases, lexical or semantic matching seldom produces the desired outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. **Memory**: A compressed representation of the database created by a long-context model, designed to handle and summarize extensive inputs efficiently.\n",
    "2. **Retriever**: A standard RAG retrieval model responsible for selecting relevant context from the knowledge base to support the generator.\n",
    "3. **Generator**: A generative language model that produces responses by combining the query with the retrieved context, similar to standard RAG setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "### 1. Memory\n",
    "- The memory module serves as an auxiliary component to enhance the retriever’s ability to identify better matches between queries and relevant parts of the database. It takes the original query and the database as inputs and produces staging answers — intermediate outputs like clues, surrogate queries, or key points — which the retriever uses instead of the original query.\n",
    "- Long-term memory is constructed by running a long-context model, such as Qwen2-7B-Instruct or Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, over the entire database. This process generates a compressed representation of the database through an attention mechanism.\n",
    "- The compressed representation is stored as key-value pairs, facilitating efficient and accurate retrieval.\n",
    "- Released memory models include memorag-qwen2-7b-inst and memorag-mistral-7b-inst, derived from Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Retriever\n",
    "- The retriever is a standard retrieval model, adapted to take processed queries (created by the memory module as staging answers) instead of the original query.\n",
    "- It outputs the retrieved **context**, which serves as the basis for generating the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Generator\n",
    "- The generator produces the final response by combining the retriever’s output (retrieved context) with the original query.\n",
    "- MemoRAG ensures compatibility and consistency by using the memory module’s underlying model as the default generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of the Approach\n",
    "1. **Extended Scope of Queries:** MemoRAG's preprocessing capabilities enable it to handle complex and long-context tasks that conventional RAG methods struggle with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Accuracy:** By simplifying and adjusting queries before retrieval, MemoRAG enhances performance over standard RAG methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility:** Adapts to diverse tasks, datasets, and retrieval scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Robustness:** Improved performance remains consistent across various generators, datasets, and query types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Efficiency**: The use of key-value compression reduces computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The memory module in MemoRAG significantly enhances comprehension of both the queries and the database, enabling more effective retrieval. Its ability to preprocess queries, generate staging answers, and leverage long-context memory models ensures high-quality responses, making MemoRAG a significant step forward in the evolution of retrieval-augmented generation.\n"

      "  - retrieval context: ['Understanding Climate Change  \\nChapter 1: Introduction to Climate Change  \\nClimate change refers to significant, long -term changes in the global climate. The term \\n\"global climate\" encompasses the planet\\'s overall weather patterns, including temperature, \\nprecipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past cent ury, human \\nactivities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \\ncontributed to climate change.  \\nHistorical Context  \\nThe Earth\\'s climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \\nbeen seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \\n11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and  human civilization. \\nMost of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\\'s orbit that \\nchange the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which \\nbegan at the end of the last ice age, human societies f lourished, but the industrial era has seen \\nunprecedented changes.  \\nModern Observations  \\nModern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \\nand extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \\ndocumented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \\nprovide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and \\npredict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily \\ndriven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhou se gases.  \\nChapter 2: Causes of Climate Change  \\nGreenhouse Gases  \\nThe primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \\natmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \\noxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is  essential \\nfor life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \\nactivities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate.  \\nFossil Fuels  \\nBurning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and \\nnatural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked \\nthe beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise \\ntoday.  \\nCoal  ', 'The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate, leading to significant ice \\nloss. Antarctic ice sheets are also losing mass, contributing to sea level rise. This melting \\naffects global ocean currents and weather patterns.  \\nGlacial Retreat  \\nGlaciers around the world are retreating, affecting water supplies for millions of people. \\nRegions dependent on glacial meltwater, such as the Himalayas and the Andes, face \\nparticular risks. Glacial melt also impacts hydropower generation and agriculture.  \\nCoastal Erosion  \\nRising sea levels and increased storm surges are accelerating coastal erosion, threatening \\nhomes, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Low -lying islands and coastal regions are especially \\nvulnerable. Coastal communities must invest in adaptation measures like s ea walls and \\nmanaged retreats.  \\nExtreme Weather Events  \\nClimate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather \\nevents, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. These events can have \\ndevastating impacts on communities, economies, and ecosystems.  \\nHurricanes and Typhoons  \\nWarmer ocean temperatures can intensify hurricanes and typhoons, leading to more \\ndestructive storms. Coastal regions are at heightened risk of storm surge and flooding. Early \\nwarning systems and resilient infrastructure are critical for mitigating these ri sks. \\nDroughts  \\nIncreased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are contributing to more frequent \\nand severe droughts. This affects agriculture, water supply, and ecosystems, particularly in \\narid and semi -arid regions. Droughts can lead to food and water shorta ges and exacerbate \\nconflicts.  \\nFlooding  \\nHeavy rainfall events are becoming more common, leading to increased flooding. Urban \\nareas with poor drainage and infrastructure are particularly at risk. Flood management \\nstrategies include improved drainage systems, green infrastructure, and floodplain r estoration.  \\nOcean Acidification  \\nIncreased CO2 levels in the atmosphere lead to higher concentrations of CO2 in the oceans. \\nThis causes the water to become more acidic, which can harm marine life, particularly \\norganisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals and some s hellfish.  \\nCoral Reefs  ', 'goals. Policies should promote synergies between biodiversity conservation and climate \\naction.  \\nChapter 10: Climate Change and Human Health  \\nHealth Impacts  \\nHeat -Related Illnesses  \\nRising temperatures and more frequent heatwaves increase the risk of heat -related illnesses, \\nsuch as heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Vulnerable populations, including the elderly, \\nchildren, and outdoor workers, are particularly at risk. Heat mitigation str ategies, such as \\ncooling centers and public health campaigns, are essential.  \\nVector -Borne Diseases  \\nClimate change affects the distribution and prevalence of vector -borne diseases, such as \\nmalaria, dengue fever, and Lyme disease. Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation \\npatterns can expand the habitats of disease -carrying insects, increasing the ri sk of outbreaks. \\nIntegrated pest management and disease surveillance are critical for prevention and control.  \\nRespiratory and Cardiovascular Diseases  \\nAir pollution, exacerbated by climate change, contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular \\ndiseases. Increased levels of ground -level ozone and particulate matter can worsen conditions \\nlike asthma and heart disease. Reducing emissions from vehicles, indus tries, and power \\nplants improves air quality and public health.  \\nFood and Water Security  \\nClimate change affects food production and water availability, impacting nutrition and health. \\nDroughts, floods, and changing growing seasons can reduce crop yields and disrupt food \\nsupply chains. Ensuring food and water security requires resilient agricul tural practices, \\nefficient water management, and emergency preparedness.  \\nHealth Adaptation Strategies  \\nPublic Health Infrastructure  \\nStrengthening public health infrastructure is vital for adapting to climate change. This \\nincludes enhancing healthcare facilities, improving disease surveillance systems, and training \\nhealthcare professionals. Community health programs can increase resilie nce and \\npreparedness for climate -related health risks.  \\nCommunity Engagement  \\nEngaging communities in health adaptation efforts ensures that strategies are relevant and \\neffective. Public awareness campaigns, participatory planning, and local health initiatives ', 'Local communities are often on the front lines of climate impacts and can be powerful agents \\nof change. Community -based conservation projects involve residents in protecting and \\nrestoring natural resources, such as forests, wetlands, and coastal areas. The se projects \\nenhance local resilience and biodiversity.  \\nEducation and Awareness  \\nRaising public awareness about climate change and sustainability is crucial for driving action. \\nEducational programs, media campaigns, and community events can inform and inspire \\nindividuals to adopt environmentally friendly practices. Schools, NGOs, and l ocal \\ngovernments play key roles in these efforts.  \\nChapter 7: The Economics of Climate Change  \\nCosts of Inaction  \\nEconomic Impacts of Climate Change  \\nThe economic costs of climate change include damage to infrastructure, reduced agricultural \\nproductivity, health care costs, and lost labor productivity. Extreme weather events, such as \\nhurricanes and floods, can cause significant economic disruption. Inve sting in climate action \\nnow can prevent much higher costs in the future.  \\nSocial and Environmental Costs  \\nClimate change exacerbates social inequalities, with marginalized communities often bearing \\nthe brunt of its impacts. Environmental costs include loss of biodiversity, ecosystem \\ndegradation, and decreased availability of natural resources. Addressing these  issues requires \\nintegrated, equitable solutions.  \\nBenefits of Climate Action  \\nEconomic Opportunities  \\nInvesting in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices creates jobs and \\nstimulates economic growth. The transition to a green economy can drive innovation and \\ncompetitiveness. Sectors such as clean technology, sustainable agriculture, and green finance \\nare emerging as significant economic drivers.  \\nHealth Benefits  \\nReducing emissions and pollution improves public health by decreasing respiratory and \\ncardiovascular diseases. Cleaner air and water contribute to overall well -being and reduce \\nhealthcare costs. Healthier environments support more active lifestyles and com munity well -\\nbeing.  \\nEcosystem Services  ', 'Ruminant animals, such as cows and sheep, produce methane during digestion. Manure \\nmanagement practices also contribute to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Innovations in \\nlivestock feeding and waste management can help mitigate these emissions.  \\nRice Cultivation  \\nFlooded rice paddies create anaerobic conditions that lead to methane production. Improved \\nwater management and rice varieties can help reduce these emissions. Research into \\nsustainable rice farming practices is crucial for balancing food security and clim ate goals.  \\nFertilizers  \\nThe use of synthetic fertilizers in agriculture releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. \\nPractices such as precision farming and organic fertilizers can mitigate these emissions. The \\ndevelopment of eco -friendly fertilizers and farming techniques is  essential for reducing the \\nagricultural sector\\'s carbon footprint.  \\nChapter 3: Effects of Climate Change  \\nThe effects of climate change are already being felt around the world and are projected to \\nintensify in the coming decades. These effects include:  \\nRising Temperatures  \\nGlobal temperatures have risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since \\nthe late 19th century. This warming is not uniform, with some regions experiencing more \\nsignificant increases than others.  \\nHeatwaves  \\nHeatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe, posing risks to human health, agriculture, \\nand infrastructure. Cities are particularly vulnerable due to the \"urban heat island\" effect. \\nHeatwaves can lead to heat -related illnesses and exacerbate existing h ealth conditions.  \\nChanging Seasons  \\nClimate change is altering the timing and length of seasons, affecting ecosystems and human \\nactivities. For example, spring is arriving earlier, and winters are becoming shorter and \\nmilder in many regions. This shift disrupts plant and animal life cycles a nd agricultural \\npractices.  \\nMelting Ice and Rising Sea Levels  \\nWarmer temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising \\nsea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the past century, \\nthreatening coastal communities and ecosystems.  \\nPolar Ice Melt  ']\n",

The term \\n\"global climate\" encompasses the planet\\'s overall weather patterns, including temperature, \\nprecipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past cent ury, human \\nactivities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \\ncontributed to climate change.  \\nHistorical Context  \\nThe Earth\\'s climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \\nbeen seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \\n11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and  human civilization. \\nMost of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\\'s orbit that \\nchange the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which \\nbegan at the end of the last ice age, human societies f lourished, but the industrial era has seen \\nunprecedented changes.  \\nModern Observations  \\nModern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \\nand extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \\ndocumented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \\nprovide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and \\npredict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily \\ndriven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhou se gases.  \\nChapter 2: Causes of Climate Change  \\nGreenhouse Gases  \\nThe primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \\natmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \\noxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is  essential \\nfor life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \\nactivities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate.  \\nFossil Fuels  \\nBurning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and \\nnatural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked \\nthe beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise \\ntoday.  \\nCoal  ', 'The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate, leading to significant ice \\nloss. Antarctic ice sheets are also losing mass, contributing to sea level rise. This melting \\naffects global ocean currents and weather patterns.  \\nGlacial Retreat  \\nGlaciers around the world are retreating, affecting water supplies for millions of people. \\nRegions dependent on glacial meltwater, such as the Himalayas and the Andes, face \\nparticular risks. Glacial melt also impacts hydropower generation and agriculture.  \\nCoastal Erosion  \\nRising sea levels and increased storm surges are accelerating coastal erosion, threatening \\nhomes, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Low -lying islands and coastal regions are especially \\nvulnerable. Coastal communities must invest in adaptation measures like s ea walls and \\nmanaged retreats.  \\nExtreme Weather Events  \\nClimate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather \\nevents, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. These events can have \\ndevastating impacts on communities, economies, and ecosystems.  \\nHurricanes and Typhoons  \\nWarmer ocean temperatures can intensify hurricanes and typhoons, leading to more \\ndestructive storms. Coastal regions are at heightened risk of storm surge and flooding. Early \\nwarning systems and resilient infrastructure are critical for mitigating these ri sks. \\nDroughts  \\nIncreased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are contributing to more frequent \\nand severe droughts. This affects agriculture, water supply, and ecosystems, particularly in \\narid and semi -arid regions. Droughts can lead to food and water shorta ges and exacerbate \\nconflicts.  \\nFlooding  \\nHeavy rainfall events are becoming more common, leading to increased flooding. Urban \\nareas with poor drainage and infrastructure are particularly at risk. Flood management \\nstrategies include improved drainage systems, green infrastructure, and floodplain r estoration.  \\nOcean Acidification  \\nIncreased CO2 levels in the atmosphere lead to higher concentrations of CO2 in the oceans. \\nThis causes the water to become more acidic, which can harm marine life, particularly \\norganisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals and some s hellfish.  \\nCoral Reefs  ', 'goals. Policies should promote synergies between biodiversity conservation and climate \\naction.  \\nChapter 10: Climate Change and Human Health  \\nHealth Impacts  \\nHeat -Related Illnesses  \\nRising temperatures and more frequent heatwaves increase the risk of heat -related illnesses, \\nsuch as heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Vulnerable populations, including the elderly, \\nchildren, and outdoor workers, are particularly at risk. Heat mitigation str ategies, such as \\ncooling centers and public health campaigns, are essential.  \\nVector -Borne Diseases  \\nClimate change affects the distribution and prevalence of vector -borne diseases, such as \\nmalaria, dengue fever, and Lyme disease. Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation \\npatterns can expand the habitats of disease -carrying insects, increasing the ri sk of outbreaks. \\nIntegrated pest management and disease surveillance are critical for prevention and control.  \\nRespiratory and Cardiovascular Diseases  \\nAir pollution, exacerbated by climate change, contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular \\ndiseases. Increased levels of ground -level ozone and particulate matter can worsen conditions \\nlike asthma and heart disease. Reducing emissions from vehicles, indus tries, and power \\nplants improves air quality and public health.  \\nFood and Water Security  \\nClimate change affects food production and water availability, impacting nutrition and health. \\nDroughts, floods, and changing growing seasons can reduce crop yields and disrupt food \\nsupply chains. Ensuring food and water security requires resilient agricul tural practices, \\nefficient water management, and emergency preparedness.  \\nHealth Adaptation Strategies  \\nPublic Health Infrastructure  \\nStrengthening public health infrastructure is vital for adapting to climate change. This \\nincludes enhancing healthcare facilities, improving disease surveillance systems, and training \\nhealthcare professionals. Community health programs can increase resilie nce and \\npreparedness for climate -related health risks.  \\nCommunity Engagement  \\nEngaging communities in health adaptation efforts ensures that strategies are relevant and \\neffective. Public awareness campaigns, participatory planning, and local health initiatives ', 'Ruminant animals, such as cows and sheep, produce methane during digestion. Manure \\nmanagement practices also contribute to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Innovations in \\nlivestock feeding and waste management can help mitigate these emissions.  \\nRice Cultivation  \\nFlooded rice paddies create anaerobic conditions that lead to methane production. Improved \\nwater management and rice varieties can help reduce these emissions.

Community -based conservation projects involve residents in protecting and \\nrestoring natural resources, such as forests, wetlands, and coastal areas. The se projects \\nenhance local resilience and biodiversity.  \\nEducation and Awareness  \\nRaising public awareness about climate change and sustainability is crucial for driving action. \\nEducational programs, media campaigns, and community events can inform and inspire \\nindividuals to adopt environmentally friendly practices. Schools, NGOs, and l ocal \\ngovernments play key roles in these efforts.  \\nChapter 7: The Economics of Climate Change  \\nCosts of Inaction  \\nEconomic Impacts of Climate Change  \\nThe economic costs of climate change include damage to infrastructure, reduced agricultural \\nproductivity, health care costs, and lost labor productivity. Extreme weather events, such as \\nhurricanes and floods, can cause significant economic disruption. Inve sting in climate action \\nnow can prevent much higher costs in the future.  \\nSocial and Environmental Costs  \\nClimate change exacerbates social inequalities, with marginalized communities often bearing \\nthe brunt of its impacts. Environmental costs include loss of biodiversity, ecosystem \\ndegradation, and decreased availability of natural resources. Addressing these  issues requires \\nintegrated, equitable solutions.  \\nBenefits of Climate Action  \\nEconomic Opportunities  \\nInvesting in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices creates jobs and \\nstimulates economic growth. The transition to a green economy can drive innovation and \\ncompetitiveness. Sectors such as clean technology, sustainable agriculture, and green finance \\nare emerging as significant economic drivers.  \\nHealth Benefits  \\nReducing emissions and pollution improves public health by decreasing respiratory and \\ncardiovascular diseases. Cleaner air and water contribute to overall well -being and reduce \\nhealthcare costs. Healthier environments support more active lifestyles and com munity well -\\nbeing.  \\nEcosystem Services  ']\n",
