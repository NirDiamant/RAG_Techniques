        "# Graph RAG with Milvus Vector Database\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "### What You'll Learn\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates an innovative approach to **Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** that combines the power of knowledge graphs with vector databases to dramatically improve question-answering performance, especially for complex multi-hop queries. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to build a Graph RAG system that can answer questions requiring multiple logical steps and relationship traversals.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Problem: Limitations of Traditional RAG\n",
        "Traditional RAG systems, while powerful, struggle with:\n",
        "- **Multi-hop questions**: Queries requiring multiple logical steps (e.g., \"What contribution did the son of Euler's teacher make?\")\n",
        "- **Complex entity relationships**: Understanding how different entities connect and relate to each other\n",
        "- **Context fragmentation**: Important relationships may be scattered across different text passages\n",
        "- **Semantic gaps**: Simple similarity search may miss logically relevant but semantically distant information\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Solution: Graph RAG with Vector Database\n",
        "This notebook presents a **unified approach** that achieves Graph RAG capabilities using **only a vector database** (Milvus), eliminating the need for separate graph databases while maintaining superior performance. Here's what makes this approach special:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Innovation**: Instead of storing explicit graph structures, we embed entities and relationships as vectors and use intelligent retrieval and expansion techniques to reconstruct graph-like reasoning paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Benefits\n",
        "1. **Simplified Architecture**: Single vector database instead of vector DB + graph DB combination\n",
        "2. **Superior Multi-hop Performance**: Handles complex queries requiring multiple relationship traversals\n",
        "3. **Scalable**: Leverages Milvus's distributed architecture for billion-scale deployments\n",
        "4. **Cost-effective**: Reduces infrastructure complexity and operational overhead\n",
        "5. **Flexible**: Works with any text corpus - just extract entities and relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "### Methodology Overview\n",
        "Our approach consists of four main stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Offline Data Preparation**\n",
        "   - Extract entities and relationships (triplets) from your text corpus\n",
        "   - Create three vector collections: entities, relationships, and passages\n",
        "   - Build adjacency mappings between entities and relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Query-time Retrieval**\n",
        "   - Retrieve similar entities and relationships using vector similarity search\n",
        "   - Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify query entities\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Subgraph Expansion** \n",
        "   - Expand retrieved entities/relationships to their neighborhood using adjacency matrices\n",
        "   - Support multi-degree expansion (1-hop, 2-hop neighbors)\n",
        "   - Merge results from both entity and relationship expansion paths\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **LLM Reranking**\n",
        "   - Use large language models to intelligently filter and rank candidate relationships\n",
        "   - Apply Chain-of-Thought reasoning to select most relevant relationships\n",
        "   - Return final passages for answer generation\n",
        "\n",
        "### Architecture Diagram\n",
        "The following diagram illustrates the complete workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](../images/graph_rag_with_milvus_1.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why This Works**: By representing both entities and relationships as vectors, we can leverage semantic similarity for initial retrieval, then use graph-theoretical expansion to discover indirect relationships, and finally apply LLM reasoning to filter for relevance. This creates a \"best of both worlds\" system that combines semantic search, graph traversal, and intelligent reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technical Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we'll implement the Graph RAG system described in our methodology overview. The implementation follows our four-stage approach: data preparation, vector storage, query processing, and intelligent reranking.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "\n",
        "To complete this demo, you need a vector database. You can get a fully-managed Milvus vector database for free by [signing up Zilliz Cloud](https://cloud.zilliz.com/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Nir-250512).

        "### LLM Reranking\n",
        "\n",
        "In this stage, we deploy the powerful self-attention mechanism of LLM to further filter and refine the candidate set of relationships. The subgraph expansion step provides us with many potentially relevant relationships, but not all of them are equally useful for answering our specific query. This is where **Large Language Models** excel - they can understand the semantic meaning of both the query and the candidate relationships, then intelligently select the most relevant ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why LLM Reranking is Necessary**:\n",
        "- **Semantic understanding**: LLMs can understand complex query intentions that pure similarity search might miss\n",
        "- **Multi-hop reasoning**: LLMs can trace logical connections across multiple relationships\n",
        "- **Context awareness**: LLMs consider how relationships work together to answer the query\n",
        "- **Quality filtering**: LLMs can identify and prioritize the most informative relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "**Chain-of-Thought Prompting Strategy**:\n",
        "We use a structured approach that encourages the LLM to:\n",
        "1. **Analyze the query**: Break down what information is needed to answer the question\n",
        "2. **Identify key connections**: Determine which types of relationships would be most helpful  \n",
        "3. **Reason about relevance**: Explain why specific relationships are chosen\n",
        "4. **Rank by importance**: Order relationships by their utility for the final answer\n",
        "\n",
        "**One-Shot Learning Pattern**: We provide a concrete example of the reasoning process to guide the LLM's behavior. This example demonstrates how to identify core entities, trace multi-hop connections, and prioritize the most direct relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "**JSON Output Format**: By requiring structured JSON output, we ensure reliable parsing and consistent results, making the system robust for production use.\n",
