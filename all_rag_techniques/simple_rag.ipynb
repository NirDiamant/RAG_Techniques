        "# Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This code implements a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for processing and querying PDF documents. The system encodes the document content into a vector store, which can then be queried to retrieve relevant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. PDF processing and text extraction\n",
        "2. Text chunking for manageable processing\n",
        "3. Vector store creation using [FAISS](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/) and OpenAI embeddings\n",
        "4. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents\n",
        "5. Evaluation of the RAG system\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method Details\n",
        "\n",
        "### Document Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The PDF is loaded using PyPDFLoader.\n",
        "2. The text is split into chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with specified chunk size and overlap.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Text Cleaning\n",
        "\n",
        "A custom function `replace_t_with_space` is applied to clean the text chunks. This likely addresses specific formatting issues in the PDF.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Vector Store Creation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the text chunks.\n",
        "2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Retriever Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A retriever is configured to fetch the top 2 most relevant chunks for a given query.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Encoding Function\n",
        "\n",
        "The `encode_pdf` function encapsulates the entire process of loading, chunking, cleaning, and encoding the PDF into a vector store.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Modular Design: The encoding process is encapsulated in a single function for easy reuse.\n",
        "2. Configurable Chunking: Allows adjustment of chunk size and overlap.\n",
        "3. Efficient Retrieval: Uses FAISS for fast similarity search.\n",
        "4. Evaluation: Includes a function to evaluate the RAG system's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage Example\n",
        "\n",
        "The code includes a test query: \"What is the main cause of climate change?\". This demonstrates how to use the retriever to fetch relevant context from the processed document.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "The system includes an `evaluate_rag` function to assess the performance of the retriever, though the specific metrics used are not detailed in the provided code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of this Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Scalability: Can handle large documents by processing them in chunks.\n",
        "2. Flexibility: Easy to adjust parameters like chunk size and number of retrieved results.\n",
        "3. Efficiency: Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
        "4. Integration with Advanced NLP: Uses OpenAI embeddings for state-of-the-art text representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This simple RAG system provides a solid foundation for building more complex information retrieval and question-answering systems. By encoding document content into a searchable vector store, it enables efficient retrieval of relevant information in response to queries. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring quick access to specific information within large documents or document collections."
