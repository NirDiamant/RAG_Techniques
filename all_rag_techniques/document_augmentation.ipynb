    "# Document Augmentation through Question Generation for Enhanced Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates a text augmentation technique that leverages additional question generation to improve document retrieval within a vector database. By generating and incorporating various questions related to each text fragment, the system enhances the standard retrieval process, thus increasing the likelihood of finding relevant documents that can be utilized as context for generative question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "By enriching text fragments with related questions, we aim to significantly enhance the accuracy of identifying the most relevant sections of a document that contain answers to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach requires a local large language model, such as Mistral or Llama 3.1, running within the Ollama framework (https://ollama.com). Alternatively, you can use the OpenAI API, but it will require minor modifications to this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t<b>PDF Processing and Text Chunking</b>: Handling PDF documents and dividing them into manageable text fragments.\n",
    "2.\t<b>Question Augmentation</b>: Generating relevant questions at both the document and fragment levels using a generative model.\n",
    "3.\t<b>Vector Store Creation</b>: Calculating embeddings for documents and creating a FAISS vector store.\n",
    "4.\t<b>Retrieval and Answer Generation</b>: Finding the most relevant document using FAISS and generating answers based on the context provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tConvert the PDF to a string.\n",
    "2.\tSplit the text into overlapping text documents (text_document) for building context purpose and then each document to overlapping text fragments (text_fragment) for retrieval and semantic search purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tGenerate questions at the document or text fragment level.\n",
    "2.\tConfigure the number of questions to generate using the QUESTIONS_PER_DOCUMENT constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Store Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tUse the OllamaEmbeddings class with models hosted on the Ollama framework to compute document embeddings.\n",
    "2.\tCreate a FAISS vector store from these embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval and Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tRetrieve the most relevant document from the FAISS store based on the given query.\n",
    "2.\tUse the retrieved document as context for generating answers with a generative model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of This Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tEnhanced Retrieval Process: Increases the probability of finding the most relevant FAISS document for a given query.\n",
    "2.\tFlexible Context Adjustment: Allows for easy adjustment of the context window size for both text documents and fragments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique provides a method to improve the quality of information retrieval in vector-based document search systems. By generating additional questions similar to user queries, it potentially leads to better comprehension and more accurate responses in subsequent tasks, such as question answering."

      "Understanding Climate Change Chapter 1 Introduction to Climate Change Climate change refers to significant long term changes in the global climate The term global climate encompasses the planet s overall weather patterns including temperature precipitation and wind patterns over an extended period Over the past century human activities particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation have significantly contributed to climate change Historical Context The Earth s climate has changed throughout history Over the past 650 000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11 700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and human civilization Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives During the Holocene epoch which began at the end of the last ice age human societies flourished but the industrial era has seen unprecedented changes Modern Observations Modern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures sea levels and extreme weather events The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC has documented these changes extensively Ice core samples tree rings and ocean sediments provide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and predict future trends The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily driven by human activities particularly the emission of greenhouse gases Chapter 2 Causes of Climate Change Greenhouse Gases The primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide CO2 methane CH4 and nitrous oxide N2O trap heat from the sun creating a greenhouse effect This effect is essential for life on Earth as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life However human activities have intensified this natural process leading to a warmer climate Fossil Fuels Burning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2 This includes coal oil and natural gas used for electricity heating and transportation The industrial revolution marked the beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption which continues to rise today Coal Coal is the most carbon intensive fossil fuel and its use for electricity generation is a major source of CO2 emissions Despite a decline in some regions coal remains a significant energy source globally It is mined extensively in countries like China India and the United States contributing significantly to their energy supplies and CO2 footprints Oil Oil is used primarily for transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel The combustion of oil products releases significant amounts of CO2 and other pollutants contributing to climate change and air quality issues The global oil industry is vast involving extraction refining and distribution with significant geopolitical and economic implications Natural Gas Natural gas is the least carbon intensive fossil fuel and is often seen as a bridge fuel to a lower carbon future However its extraction and use still contribute to greenhouse gas emissions particularly methane which is a potent greenhouse gas Innovations in fracking technology have made natural gas more accessible but this comes with environmental and health concerns Deforestation Forests act as carbon sinks absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere When trees are cut down for timber or to clear land for agriculture this stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere Deforestation reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2 exacerbating the greenhouse effect Tropical Deforestation Tropical rainforests are particularly important for carbon storage Deforestation in the Amazon Congo Basin and Southeast Asia has significant impacts on global carbon cycles and biodiversity These regions are often cleared for agriculture logging and mining leading to habitat loss and species extinction Boreal Forests Boreal forests found in the northern regions of North America Europe and Asia also play a crucial role in sequestering carbon Logging and land use changes in these regions contribute to climate change These forests are vital for regulating the Earth s climate and supporting indigenous communities and wildlife Agriculture Agriculture contributes to climate change through methane emissions from livestock rice paddies and the use of synthetic fertilizers Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a much higher heat trapping capability than CO2 albeit in smaller quantities Livestock Emissions Ruminant animals such as cows and sheep produce methane during digestion Manure management practices also contribute to methane and nitrous oxide emissions Innovations in livestock feeding and waste management can help mitigate these emissions Rice Cultivation Flooded rice paddies create anaerobic conditions that lead to methane production Improved water management and rice varieties can help reduce these emissions Research into sustainable rice farming practices is crucial for balancing food security and climate goals Fertilizers The use of synthetic fertilizers in agriculture releases nitrous oxide a potent greenhouse gas Practices such as precision farming and organic fertilizers can mitigate these emissions The development of eco friendly fertilizers and farming techniques is essential for reducing the agricultural sector s carbon footprint Chapter 3 Effects of Climate Change The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world and are projected to intensify in the coming decades These effects include Rising Temperatures Global temperatures have risen by about 1 2 degrees Celsius 2 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century This warming is not uniform with some regions experiencing more significant increases than others Heatwaves Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe posing risks to human health agriculture and infrastructure Cities are particularly vulnerable due to the urban heat island effect Heatwaves can lead to heat related illnesses and exacerbate existing health conditions Changing Seasons Climate change is altering the timing and length of seasons affecting ecosystems and human activities For example spring is arriving earlier and winters are becoming shorter and milder in many regions This shift disrupts plant and animal life cycles and agricultural practices Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels Warmer temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt contributing to rising sea levels Sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters 8 inches in the past century threatening coastal communities and ecosystems Polar Ice Melt The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate leading to significant ice loss Antarctic ice sheets are also losing mass contributing to sea level rise This melting affects global ocean currents and weather patterns Glacial Retreat Glaciers around the world are retreating affecting water supplies for millions of people Regions dependent on glacial meltwater such as the Himalayas and the Andes face particular risks Glacial melt also impacts hydropower generation and agriculture Coastal Erosion Rising sea levels and increased storm surges are accelerating coastal erosion threatening homes infrastructure and ecosystems Low lying islands and coastal regions are especially vulnerable Coastal communities must invest in adaptation measures like sea walls and managed retreats Extreme Weather Events Climate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes heatwaves droughts and heavy rainfall These events can have devastating impacts on communities economies and ecosystems Hurricanes and Typhoons Warmer ocean temperatures can intensify hurricanes and typhoons leading to more destructive storms Coastal regions are at heightened risk of storm surge and flooding Early warning systems and resilient infrastructure are critical for mitigating these risks Droughts Increased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are contributing to more frequent and severe droughts This affects agriculture water supply and ecosystems particularly in arid and semi arid regions Droughts can lead to food and water shortages and exacerbate conflicts Flooding Heavy rainfall events are becoming more common leading to increased flooding Urban areas with poor drainage and infrastructure are particularly at risk Flood management strategies include improved drainage systems green infrastructure and floodplain restoration Ocean Acidification Increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere lead to higher concentrations of CO2 in the oceans This causes the water to become more acidic which can harm marine life particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons such as corals and some shellfish Coral Reefs Coral reefs are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and acidity Ocean acidification and warming waters contribute to coral bleaching and mortality threatening biodiversity and fisheries Protecting and restoring coral reefs is essential for marine conservation Marine Ecosystems Acidification affects the health and survival of various marine species disrupting food webs and ecosystems This has implications for commercial fisheries and the livelihoods of people who depend on the ocean Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and enhance marine protected areas are vital Chapter 4 Mitigation and Adaptation Addressing climate change requires a two pronged approach mitigation and adaptation Mitigation involves reducing or preventing the emission of greenhouse gases while adaptation involves making adjustments to social economic and environmental practices to minimize the damage caused by climate change Renewable Energy Transitioning to renewable energy sources such as wind solar and hydroelectric power is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions These sources produce little to no emissions and are sustainable in the long

commercial and industrial uses Floating Solar Farms Floating solar farms installed on water bodies offer a way to generate solar power without using valuable land space These systems can also reduce evaporation from water bodies and improve solar panel efficiency due to the cooling effect of water Offshore Wind Farms Offshore wind farms have the potential to generate vast amounts of electricity They are typically located far from shore where winds are stronger and more consistent Innovations in turbine design and installation methods are making offshore wind an increasingly cost competitive option Energy Storage and Grid Management Battery Storage Advances in battery technology particularly in lithium ion and solid state batteries are improving energy storage capacity and efficiency Large scale battery storage systems can help balance supply and demand making renewable energy sources like solar and wind more reliable Smart Grids Smart grids use digital technology to manage electricity more efficiently They can integrate various renewable energy sources respond to demand fluctuations and reduce energy waste Smart meters sensors and advanced analytics play crucial roles in these systems Pumped Hydro Storage Pumped hydro storage involves storing energy by moving water between two reservoirs at different elevations During periods of high electricity demand water is released from the upper reservoir to generate electricity This method provides a large scale long duration storage solution Carbon Capture and Utilization Direct Air Capture Direct air capture DAC technology involves removing CO2 directly from the atmosphere The captured CO2 can be stored underground or used in various industrial processes DAC is an emerging technology with the potential to play a significant role in achieving net zero emissions Carbon Utilization Captured CO2 can be used to produce building materials synthetic fuels and other products This process not only reduces
