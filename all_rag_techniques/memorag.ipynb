    "# MemoRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Memory Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "MemoRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that incorporates a memory model as an auxiliary step before the retrieval phase. In doing so, it bridges the gap in contextual understanding and reasoning that standard RAG techniques face when addressing queries with implicit or ambiguous information needs and unstructured external knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Standard RAG techniques rely heavily on lexical or semantic matching between the query and the knowledge base. While this approach works well for clear question answering tasks with structured knowledge, it often falls short when handling queries with implicit or ambiguous information (e.g., describing the relationships between main characters in a novel) or when the knowledge base is unstructured (e.g., fiction books). In such cases, lexical or semantic matching seldom produces the desired outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. **Memory**: A compressed representation of the database created by a long-context model, designed to handle and summarize extensive inputs efficiently.\n",
    "2. **Retriever**: A standard RAG retrieval model responsible for selecting relevant context from the knowledge base to support the generator.\n",
    "3. **Generator**: A generative language model that produces responses by combining the query with the retrieved context, similar to standard RAG setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "### 1. Memory\n",
    "- The memory module serves as an auxiliary component to enhance the retriever’s ability to identify better matches between queries and relevant parts of the database. It takes the original query and the database as inputs and produces staging answers — intermediate outputs like clues, surrogate queries, or key points — which the retriever uses instead of the original query.\n",
    "- Long-term memory is constructed by running a long-context model, such as Qwen2-7B-Instruct or Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, over the entire database. This process generates a compressed representation of the database through an attention mechanism.\n",
    "- The compressed representation is stored as key-value pairs, facilitating efficient and accurate retrieval.\n",
    "- Released memory models include memorag-qwen2-7b-inst and memorag-mistral-7b-inst, derived from Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Retriever\n",
    "- The retriever is a standard retrieval model, adapted to take processed queries (created by the memory module as staging answers) instead of the original query.\n",
    "- It outputs the retrieved **context**, which serves as the basis for generating the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Generator\n",
    "- The generator produces the final response by combining the retriever’s output (retrieved context) with the original query.\n",
    "- MemoRAG ensures compatibility and consistency by using the memory module’s underlying model as the default generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of the Approach\n",
    "1. **Extended Scope of Queries:** MemoRAG's preprocessing capabilities enable it to handle complex and long-context tasks that conventional RAG methods struggle with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Accuracy:** By simplifying and adjusting queries before retrieval, MemoRAG enhances performance over standard RAG methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility:** Adapts to diverse tasks, datasets, and retrieval scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Robustness:** Improved performance remains consistent across various generators, datasets, and query types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Efficiency**: The use of key-value compression reduces computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The memory module in MemoRAG significantly enhances comprehension of both the queries and the database, enabling more effective retrieval. Its ability to preprocess queries, generate staging answers, and leverage long-context memory models ensures high-quality responses, making MemoRAG a significant step forward in the evolution of retrieval-augmented generation.\n"

He suggests that when people act in their own self-interest, they contribute to economic activities that benefit others, leading to mutual gains. For instance, the competition among producers to meet consumer demands can enhance overall productivity and improve living standards, as the prosperity of individuals ultimately supports the welfare of the entire community. Thus, self-interest can align with the general interest of society, as the actions of individuals can lead to positive outcomes for the collective.\n",

      "Final Answer: Capital accumulation leads to economic growth by enabling the maintenance and employment of a greater number of laborers, which in turn allows for a more effective division of labor. As stock is accumulated, it facilitates improvements in the productive powers of labor, allowing for a more proper distribution of employment and the provision of better machinery. This results in a greater quantity of work produced with the same amount of labor, as labor becomes increasingly subdivided and specialized. Consequently, the increase in capital not only enhances the efficiency of labor but also raises the overall productivity and value of the annual output of society.\n",

In Great Britain industry is perfectly secure;\\nand though it is far from being perfectly free, it is as free or freer\\nthan in any other part of Europe.\\nThough the period of the greatest prosperity and improvement', 'of Great Britain so far forgot the gene rosity which is natural to\\ntheir station, as to demand the exclusive privilege of supplying\\ntheir countrymen with corn and butch er’s meat.

The improvement and prosperity\\nof Great Britain, which has been so often ascribed to those laws,\\nmay very easily be accounted for by other causes.

For instance, the competition among producers to meet consumer demands can enhance overall productivity and improve living standards, as the prosperity of individuals ultimately supports the welfare of the entire community. Thus, self-interest can align with the general interest of society, as the actions of individuals can lead to positive outcomes for the collective.\n",

The inhabitants of the country purchase of\\nthe town a greater quantity of manufactured goods with the\\nproduce of a much smaller quantity of their own labour , than they\\nmust have employed had they attempted to prepare them\\nthemselves.

Of Taxes.\\nThe private revenue of individuals, it has been shown in the ﬁrst\\nbook of this Inquiry , arises, ultimately from three different sources;\\nrent, proﬁt, and wages.

I shall endeavour  to give the best account I\\ncan, ﬁrst, of those taxes which, it is intended should fall upon rent;\\nsecondly , of those which, it is intended should fall upon proﬁt;\\nthirdly , of those which, it is intended should fall upon wages; and\\nfourthly , of those which, it is intended should fall indifferently', 'thirdly , of those which, it is intended should fall upon wages; and\\nfourthly , of those which, it is intended should fall indifferently\\nupon all those three different sources of private revenue. The\\nparticular consideration of each of these four different sorts of\\ntaxes will divide the second part of the present chapter into four\\narticles, three of which will require several other subdivisions.\\nMany of these taxes, it will appear from the following review , are\\nnot ﬁnally paid from the fund, or source of revenue, upon which it\\nis intended they should fall.\\nBefore I enter upon the examination of particular taxes, it is\\nnecessary to premise the four followin g maxims with regard to\\ntaxes in general.\\n1. The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the\\nsupport of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to\\ntheir respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which\\nthey respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. The', 'general welfare of the society; yet they have given occasion to very\\ndifferent theories of political economy; of which some magnify the\\nimportance of that industry which is carried on in towns, others of\\nthat which is carried on in the country . Those theories have had a\\nconsiderable inﬂuence, not only upon the opinions of men of\\nlearning, but upon the public conduct  of princes and sovereign\\nstates. I have endeavoured, in the fourth book, to explain as fully\\nand distinctly as I can those different theories, and the principal\\neffects which they have produced in dif ferent ages and nations.\\nTo explain in what has consisted the revenue of the great body\\nof the people, or what has been the nature of those funds, which, in\\ndifferent ages and nations, have supplied their annual\\nconsumption, is the object of these four ﬁrst books. The ﬁfth and\\nlast book treats of the revenue of the sovereign, or commonwealth.\\nIn this book I have endeavoured to shew , ﬁrst, what are the', 'reasons and causes which have induced almost all modern\\ngovernments to mortgage some part of this revenue, or to contract\\ndebts; and what have been the effects of those debts upon the real\\nwealth, the annual produce of the land and labour of the society .1/25/25, 7:29 PM The Wealth of Nations | Project Gutenberg\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ﬁles/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm 5/654', 'altogether upon themselves, and always with a considerable\\noverchar ge. They fall heaviest upon the landlords, who always pay\\nin a double capacity; in that of landlords, by the reduction, of their\\nrent; and in that of rich consumers, by the increase of their\\nexpense. The observation of Sir Matthew Decker , that certain taxes\\nare, in the price of certain goods, sometimes repeated and\\naccumulated four or ﬁve times, is perfectly just with regard to\\ntaxes upon the necessaries of life. In the price of leather , for\\nexample, you must pay not only for the tax upon the leather of\\nyour own shoes, but for a part of that upon those of the shoemaker\\nand the tanner . You must pay, too, for the tax upon the salt, upon\\nthe soap, and upon the candles which those workmen consume\\nwhile employed in your service; and for the tax upon the leather ,\\nwhich the saltmaker , the soap-maker , and the candle-maker\\nconsume, while employed in their service.', 'The law, contrary to all the ordinary principles of justice, ﬁrst\\ncreates the temptation, and then punishe s those who yield to it; and\\nit commonly enhances the punishment, too, in proportion to the\\nvery circumstance which ought certainly to alleviate it, the\\ntemptation to commit the crime. {See Sketches of the History of\\nMan page 474, and Seq.} Fourthly , by subjecting the people to the\\nfrequent visits and the odious examination of the tax-gatherers, it\\nmay expose them to much unnecessary trouble, vexation, and\\noppression; and though vexation is not, strictly speaking, expense,\\nit is certainly equivalent to the expense at which every man would\\nbe willing to redeem himself from it. It is in some one or other of\\nthese four different ways, that taxes are frequently so much more\\nburdensome to the people than they are beneﬁcial to the sovereign.\\nThe evident justice and utility of the foregoing maxims have\\nrecommended them, more or less, to the attention of all nations.', 'their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which\\nthey respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. The\\nexpense of government to the individuals of a great nation, is like\\nthe expense of management to the joint tenants of a great estate,\\nwho are all obliged to contribute in proportion to their respective\\ninterests in the estate. In the observation or neglect of this maxim,\\nconsists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation. Every\\ntax, it must be observed once for all, which falls ﬁnally upon one\\nonly of the three sorts of revenue above mentioned, is necessarily\\nunequal, in so far as it does not affect the other two. In the\\nfollowing examination of different taxes, I shall seldom take much\\nfarther notice of this sort of inequality; but shall, in most cases,\\nconﬁne my observations to that inequality which is occasioned by\\na particular tax falling unequally upon that particular sort of\\nprivate revenue which is af fected by it.', 'ought ever to be taxed.

But there\\nare other employments in which the same quantity of industry will\\nnot always produce the same quantity of commodities.

This rate is naturally regulated,\\nas I shall shew hereafter , partly by the general circumstances of the\\nsociety , their riches or poverty , their advancing, stationary , or\\ndeclining condition, and partly by the particular nature of each\\nemployment.\\nThere is likewise in every society or neighbourhood an ordinary\\nor average rate of rent, which is regul ated, too, as I shall shew\\nhereafter , partly by the general circum stances of the society or\\nneighbourhood in which the land is situated, and partly by the\\nnatural or improved fertility of the land.\\nThese ordinary or average rates may be called the natural rates\\nof wages, proﬁt and rent, at the time and place in which they\\ncommonly prevail.\\nWhen the price of any commodity is neither more nor less than', 'the demand for labour , tends to lower its price, as the high price of\\nprovisions tends to raise it. The plenty of a cheap year, on the\\ncontrary , by increasing the demand, tends to raise the price of\\nlabour , as the cheapness of provisions tends to lower it. In the\\nordinary variations of the prices of provisions, those two opposite\\ncauses seem to counterbalance one another , which is probably , in\\npart, the reason why the wages of labour are everywhere so much\\nmore steady and permanent than the price of provisions.\\nThe increase in the wages of labour necessarily increases the\\nprice of many commodities, by increasing that part of it which\\nresolves itself into wages, and so far tends to diminish their\\nconsumption, both at home and abroad. The same cause, however ,\\nwhich raises the wages of labour , the increase of stock, tends to\\nincrease its productive powers, and to make a smaller quantity of\\nlabour produce a greater quantity of work. The owner of the stock', 'quantity , of the rude produce, is no doubt affected in its yearly\\nvalue by all the occasional and temporary ﬂuctuations in the\\nmarket price of that rude produce; but it is seldom affected by\\nthem in its yearly rate. In settling the terms of the lease, the\\nlandlord and farmer endeavour , according to their best judgment,\\nto adjust that rate, not to the temporary and occasional, but to the\\naverage and ordinary price of the produce.\\nSuch ﬂuctuations affect both the value  and the rate, either of\\nwages or of proﬁt, according as the market happens to be either\\noverstocked or understocked with commodities or with labour ,\\nwith work done, or with work to be done. A public mourning raises\\nthe price of black cloth (with which the market is almost always\\nunderstocked upon such occasions), and augments the proﬁts of\\nthe merchants who possess any considerable quantity of it. It has\\nno effect upon the wages of the weavers. The market is', 'of linen and woollen cloth. It is only the average produce of the\\none species of industry which can be suited, in any respect, to the\\neffectual demand; and as its actual produce is frequently much\\ngreater , and frequently much less, than its average produce, the\\nquantity of the commodities brought to market will sometimes\\nexceed a good deal, and sometimes fall short a good deal, of the\\neffectual demand. Even though that demand, therefore, should\\ncontinue always the same, their market price will be liable to great\\nﬂuctuations, will sometimes fall a good deal below , and sometimes\\nrise a good deal above, their natural price. In the other species of\\nindustry , the produce of equal quantities  of labour being always the\\nsame, or very nearly the same, it can be more exactly suited to the\\neffectual demand.

The effects of the division of\\nlabour , in the general business of society , will be more easily\\nunderstood, by considering in what manner it operates in some\\nparticular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be carried\\nfurthest in some very triﬂing ones; not perhaps that it really is\\ncarried further in them than in others of more importance: but in\\nthose triﬂing manufactures which are destined to supply the small\\nwants of but a small number of peop le, the whole number of\\nworkmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\\ndifferent branch of the work can often be collected into the same\\nworkhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator .', 'hundredth, part of what they are at present capable of performing,\\nin consequence of a proper division and combination of their\\ndifferent operations.\\nIn every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of\\nlabour are similar to what they are in this very triﬂing one, though,\\nin many of them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided,\\nnor reduced to so great a simplicity of operation. The division of\\nlabour , however , so far as it can be introduced, occasions, in every\\nart, a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labour .\\nThe separation of different trades and employments from one\\nanother , seems to have taken place in consequence of this\\nadvantage. This separation, too, is generally carried furthest in\\nthose countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and\\nimprovement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of\\nsociety , being generally that of several in an improved one. In\\nevery improved society , the farmer is generally nothing but a', 'subdivision of employment in philosophy , as well as in every other\\nbusiness, improves dexterity , and saves time. Each individual\\nbecomes more expert in his own peculiar branch, more work is\\ndone upon the whole, and the quantity of science is considerably\\nincreased by it.\\nIt is the great multiplication of the productions of all the\\ndifferent arts, in consequence of the division of labour , which\\noccasions, in a well-governed society , that universal opulence\\nwhich extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every\\nworkman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of\\nbeyond what he himself has occasi on for; and every other\\nworkman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to\\nexchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or,\\nwhat comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of\\ntheirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion\\nfor, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has', 'provisions, and a greater stock of materials and tools than what\\nwould have been necessary in a ruder state of things, must be\\naccumulated before-hand. But the number of workmen in every\\nbranch of business generally increases with the division of labour\\nin that branch; or rather it is the increase of their number which\\nenables them to class and subdivide themselves in this manner .\\nAs the accumulation of stock is previously necessary for\\ncarrying on this great improvement in the productive powers of\\nlabour , so that accumulation naturally leads to this improvement.\\nThe person who employs his stock in maintaining labour ,\\nnecessarily wishes to employ it in such a manner as to produce as\\ngreat a quantity of work as possible. He endeavours, therefore,\\nboth to make among his workmen the most proper distribution of\\nemployment, and to furnish them with the best machines which he\\ncan either invent or afford to purchase. His abilities, in both these', 'which raises the wages of labour , the increase of stock, tends to\\nincrease its productive powers, and to make a smaller quantity of\\nlabour produce a greater quantity of work. The owner of the stock\\nwhich employs a great number of labourers necessarily\\nendeavours, for his own advantage, to make such a proper division\\nand distribution of employment, that they may be enabled to\\nproduce the greatest quantity of work possible. For the same\\nreason, he endeavours to supply them with the best machinery\\nwhich either he or they can think of. What takes place among the\\nlabourers in a particular workhouse, takes place, for the same\\nreason, among those of a great society . The greater their number ,\\nthe more they naturally divide themselves into different classes and\\nsubdivisions of employments. More heads are occupied in\\ninventing the most proper machinery for executing the work of\\neach, and it is, therefore, more likely to be invented. There are', 'before-hand stored up somewhere, either in his own possession, or\\nin that of some other person, a stock sufﬁcient to maintain him,\\nand to supply him with the materials and tools of his work, till he\\nhas not only completed, but sold his web.

Every man endeavours to\\nsupply , by his own industry , his own occasional wants, as they\\noccur . When he is hungry , he goes to the forest to hunt; when his\\ncoat is worn out, he clothes himself with the skin of the ﬁrst large\\nanimal he kills: and when his hut begins to go to ruin, he repairs it,\\nas well as he can, with the trees and the turf that are nearest it.\\nBut when the division of labour has once been thoroughly\\nintroduced, the produce of a man’ s own labour can supply but a\\nvery small part of his occasional wants. The far greater part of', 'labourers, is destined for replacing a capital, is not only much\\ngreater in rich than in poor countries, but bears a much greater\\nproportion to that which is immediately destined for constituting a\\nrevenue either as rent or as proﬁt. The funds destined for the\\nmaintenance of productive labour are not only much greater in the\\nformer than in the latter , but bear a much greater proportion to\\nthose which, though they may be employed to maintain either\\nproductive or unproductive hands, have generally a predilection for\\nthe latter .\\nThe proportion between those different funds necessarily\\ndetermines in every country the general character of the inhabitants\\nas to industry or idleness. We are more industrious than our\\nforefathers, because, in the present times, the funds destined for the\\nmaintenance of industry are much greater in proportion to those\\nwhich are likely to be employed in the maintenance of idleness,\\nthan they were two or three centuries ago. Our ancestors were idle', 'abundance or scantiness of its annual supply must depend, during\\nthe continuance of that state, upon the proportion between the\\nnumber of those who are annually employed in useful labour , and\\nthat of those who are not so employed.  The number of useful and\\nproductive labourers, it will hereafter appear , is everywhere in\\nproportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in\\nsetting them to work, and to the particular way in which it is so\\nemployed. The second book, therefore, treats of the nature of\\ncapital stock, of the manner in which it is gradually accumulated,\\nand of the different quantities of labour which it puts into motion,\\naccording to the dif ferent ways in which it is employed.\\nNations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity , and\\njudgment, in the application of labour , have followed very different\\nplans in the general conduct or direction of it; and those plans have\\nnot all been equally favourable to the greatness of its produce. The', 'productive labour , the notions which it inculcates are, perhaps, too\\nnarrow and conﬁned; yet in representing the wealth of nations as\\nconsisting, not in the unconsumable riches of money , but in the\\nconsumable goods annually reproduced by the labour of the\\nsociety , and in representing perfect liberty as the only effectual\\nexpedient for rendering this annual reproduction the greatest\\npossible, its doctrine seems to be in every respect as just as it is\\ngenerous and liberal. Its followers are very numerous; and as men\\nare fond of paradoxes, and of appearing to understand what\\nsurpasses the comprehensions of ordinary people, the paradox\\nwhich it maintains, concerning the unproductive nature of\\nmanufacturing labour , has not, perhaps, contributed a little to\\nincrease the number of its admirers. They have for some years past\\nmade a pretty considerable sect, distinguished in the French\\nrepublic of letters by the name of the Economists. Their works', 'species, but only continued it as it was before. Farmers and\\ncountry labourers, indeed, over and above the stock which\\nmaintains and employs them, reproduce annually a neat produce, a\\nfree rent to the landlord. As a marriage which affords three\\nchildren is certainly more productive than one which affords only\\ntwo, so the labour of farmers and country labourers is certainly\\nmore productive than that of merchants, artiﬁcers, and\\nmanufacturers. The superior produce of the one class, however ,\\ndoes not, render the other barren or unproductive.\\nSecondly , it seems, on this account, altogether improper to\\nconsider artiﬁcers, manufacturers, and merchants, in the same light\\nas menial servants. The labour of menial servants does not\\ncontinue the existence of the fund which maintains and employs\\nthem.

That work consists in services', 'orator , or the tune of the musician, the work of all of them perishes\\nin the very instant of its production.\\nBoth productive and unproductive labourers, and those who do\\nnot labour at all, are all equally maintai ned by the annual produce\\nof the land and labour of the country . This produce, how great\\nsoever , can never be inﬁnite, but must have certain limits.\\nAccording, therefore, as a smaller or greater proportion of it is in\\nany one year employed in maintaining unproductive hands, the\\nmore in the one case, and the less in the other , will remain for the\\nproductive, and the next year’s produce will be greater or smaller\\naccordingly; the whole annual produce, if we except the\\nspontaneous productions of the earth, being the effect of\\nproductive labour .\\nThough the whole annual produce of the land and labour of\\nevery country is no doubt ultimately destined for supplying the\\nconsumption of its inhabitants, and for procuring a revenue to', 'of the circulating capital which consists in money is an\\nimprovement of exactly the same kind.\\nIt is sufﬁciently obvious, and it has partly , too, been explained\\nalready , in what manner every saving in the expense of supporting\\nthe ﬁxed capital is an improvement of the neat revenue of the\\nsociety . The whole capital of the undertaker of every work is\\nnecessarily divided between his ﬁxed and his circulating capital.\\nWhile his whole capital remains the same, the smaller the one part,\\nthe greater must necessarily be the other . It is the circulating\\ncapital which furnishes the materials and wages of labour , and puts\\nindustry into motion.

Its followers are very numerous; and as men\\nare fond of paradoxes, and of appearing to understand what\\nsurpasses the comprehensions of ordinary people, the paradox\\nwhich it maintains, concerning the unproductive nature of\\nmanufacturing labour , has not, perhaps, contributed a little to\\nincrease the number of its admirers.

The effects of the division of\\nlabour , in the general business of society , will be more easily\\nunderstood, by considering in what manner it operates in some\\nparticular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be carried\\nfurthest in some very triﬂing ones; not perhaps that it really is\\ncarried further in them than in others of more importance: but in\\nthose triﬂing manufactures which are destined to supply the small\\nwants of but a small number of peop le, the whole number of\\nworkmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\\ndifferent branch of the work can often be collected into the same\\nworkhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator .', 'produce.

To attempt, however , prematurely , and\\nwith an insufﬁcient capital, to do all the three, is certainly not the\\nshortest way for a society , no more than it would be for an\\nindividual, to acquire a sufﬁcient one. The capital of all the\\nindividuals of a nation has its limits, in the same manner as that of\\na single individual, and is capable of executing only certain\\npurposes. The capital of all the individuals of a nation is increased\\nin the same manner as that of a single individual, by their\\ncontinually accumulating and adding to it whatever they save out\\nof their revenue. It is likely to increase the fastest, therefore, when\\nit is employed in the way that affords the greatest revenue to all the', 'become idle and poor, in consequence  of a great lord’ s having\\ntaken up his residence in their neighbourhood.\\nThe proportion between capital and revenue, therefore, seems\\neverywhere to regulate the proportion between industry and\\nidleness Wherever capital predomi nates, industry prevails;\\nwherever revenue, idleness. Every increase or diminution of\\ncapital, therefore, naturally tends to increase or diminish the real\\nquantity of industry , the number of productive hands, and\\nconsequently the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the\\nland and labour of the country , the real wealth and revenue of all\\nits inhabitants.\\nCapitals are increased by parsimony , and diminished by\\nprodigality and misconduct.\\nWhatever a person saves from his revenue he adds to his capital,\\nand either employs it himself in maintaining an additional number\\nof productive hands, or enables some other person to do so, by\\nlending it to him for an interest, that is, for a share of the proﬁts.', 'those powers, or, in other words, according to the supposed natural\\nor improved fertility of the land. It is the work of Nature which\\nremains, after deducting or compensating every thing which can be\\nregarded as the work of man. It is seldom less than a fourth, and\\nfrequently more than a third, of the whole produce. No equal\\nquantity of productive labour employed in manufactures, can ever\\noccasion so great reproduction. In them Nature does nothing; man\\ndoes all; and the reproduction must always be in proportion to the\\nstrength of the agents that occasion it. The capital employed in\\nagriculture, therefore, not only puts into motion a greater quantity\\nof productive labour than any equal capital employed in\\nmanufactures; but in proportion, too, to the quantity of productive\\nlabour which it employs, it adds a much  greater value to the annual\\nproduce of the land and labour of the country , to the real wealth\\nand revenue of its inhabitants.

But after the division of labour has\\nonce thoroughly taken place, it is but a very small part of these\\nwith which a man’ s own labour can supply him. The far greater\\npart of them he must derive from the labour of other people, and he\\nmust be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labour which\\nhe can command, or which he can afford to purchase. The value of\\nany commodity , therefore, to the person  who possesses it, and who\\nmeans not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for\\nother commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it\\nenables him to purchase or command. Labour therefore, is the real\\nmeasure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.', 'other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it\\nenables him to purchase or command. Labour therefore, is the real\\nmeasure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.\\nThe real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the\\nman who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.\\nWhat every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it\\nand who wants to dispose of it, or exchange it for something else,\\nis the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it\\ncan impose upon other people. What is bought with money , or with\\ngoods, is purchased by labour , as much as what we acquire by the\\ntoil of our own body . That money , or those goods, indeed, save us\\nthis toil. They contain the value of a certain quantity of labour ,\\nwhich we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain the\\nvalue of an equal quantity . Labour was the ﬁrst price, the original\\npurchase money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or', 'there very high, but that the real value of those commodities is\\nvery low .\\nLabour , it must always be remembered, and not any particular\\ncommodity , or set of commodities, is the real measure of the value\\nboth of silver and of all other commodities.\\nBut in countries almost waste, or but thinly inhabited, cattle,\\npoultry , game of all kinds, etc. as they are the spontaneous\\nproductions of Nature, so she frequently produces them in much\\ngreater quantities than the consumption of the inhabitants requires.\\nIn such a state of things, the suppl y commonly exceeds the\\ndemand.

The labourer is rich or poor, is well or ill rewarded, in\\nproportion to the real, not to the nominal price of his labour .\\nThe distinction between the real and the nominal price of\\ncommodities and labour is not a matter of mere speculation, but\\nmay sometimes be of considerable use in practice. The same real\\nprice is always of the same value; but on account of the variations\\nin the value of gold and silver , the same nominal price is\\nsometimes of very different values.

In\\nconsequence of its being the instrument of commerce, when we\\nhave money we can more readily obtain whatever else we have\\noccasion for, than by means of any other commodity . The great\\naffair, we always ﬁnd, is to get money . When that is obtained, there\\nis no difﬁculty in making any subsequent purchase. In\\nconsequence of its being the measure of value, we estimate that of\\nall other commodities by the quantity of money which they will\\nexchange for. We say of a rich man, that he is worth a great deal,\\nand of a poor man, that he is worth very little money . A frugal man,\\nor a man eager to be rich, is said to love money; and a careless, a\\ngenerous, or a profuse man, is said to be indifferent about it. To', 'and extravagance, be in great want of them the next. Money , on the\\ncontrary , is a steady friend, which, though it may travel about from\\nhand to hand, yet if it can be kept from going out of the country , is\\nnot very liable to be wasted and consumed. Gold and silver ,\\ntherefore, are, according to him, the must solid and substantial part\\nof the moveable wealth of a nation; and to multiply those metals\\nought, he thinks, upon that account, to be the great object of its\\npolitical economy .\\nOthers admit, that if a nation could be separated from all the\\nworld, it would be of no consequence how much or how little\\nmoney circulated in it. The consumable goods, which were\\ncirculated by means of this money , would only be exchanged for a\\ngreater or a smaller number of pieces; but the real wealth or\\npoverty of the country , they allow , would depend altogether upon\\nthe abundance or scarcity of those consumable goods. But it is\\notherwise, they think, with countries which have connections with', 'even it draws them. Goods can serve many other purposes besides\\npurchasing money , but money can serve no other purpose besides\\npurchasing goods. Money , therefore, necessarily runs after goods,\\nbut goods do not always or necessarily run after money . The man\\nwho buys, does not always mean to sell again, but frequently to\\nuse or to consume; whereas he who sells always means to buy\\nagain. The one may frequently have done the whole, but the other\\ncan never have done more than the one half of his business.

The\\nquantity of money which he gets for them regulates, too, the\\nquantity of bread and beer which he can afterwards purchase. It is\\nmore natural and obvious to him, therefore, to estimate their value\\nby the quantity of money , the commodity for which he\\nimmediately exchanges them, than by that of bread and beer, the\\ncommodities for which he can exchange them only by the\\nintervention of another commodity; and rather to say that his\\nbutcher ’s meat is worth three-pence or fourpence a-pound, than\\nthat it is worth three or four pounds of bread, or three or four\\nquarts of small beer. Hence it comes to pass, that the exchangeable\\nvalue of every commodity is more frequently estimated by the\\nquantity of money , than by the quantity either of labour or of any\\nother commodity which can be had in exchange for it.\\nGold and silver , however , like every other commodity , vary in\\ntheir value; are sometimes cheaper and sometimes dearer ,', 'goods in proportion to that of others, we can infer, with a degree of\\nprobability that approaches almost to certainty , that it was rich or\\npoor, that the greater part of its lands were improved or\\nunimproved, and that it was either in a more or less barbarous\\nstate, or in a more or less civilized one.\\nAny rise in the money price of goods which proceeded\\naltogether from the degradation of the value of silver , would affect\\nall sorts of goods equally , and raise their price universally , a third,\\nor a fourth, or a ﬁfth part higher , according as silver happened to\\nlose a third, or a fourth, or a ﬁfth part of its former value.

Humanity may in this case require that\\nthe freedom of trade should be restored only by slow gradations,\\nand with a good deal of reserve and circumspection. Were those\\nhigh duties and prohibitions taken away all at once, cheaper\\nforeign goods of the same kind might be poured so fast into the\\nhome market, as to deprive all at once many thousands of our\\npeople of their ordinary employment and means of subsistence.\\nThe disorder which this would occasion might no doubt be very\\nconsiderable. It would in all probabilit y, however , be much less\\nthan is commonly imagined, for the two following reasons.', 'in all future times, deliver her from this danger; which can enable\\nher, or even force her, to withdraw some part of her capital from\\nthis overgrown employment, and to turn it, though with less proﬁt,\\ntowards other employments; and which, by gradually diminishing\\none branch of her industry , and gradually increasing all the rest,\\ncan, by degrees, restore all the different branches of it to that\\nnatural, healthful, and proper proportion, which perfect liberty\\nnecessarily establishes, and which perfect liberty can alone\\npreserve. To open the colony trade all at once to all nations, might\\nnot only occasion some transitory inconveniency , but a great\\npermanent loss, to the greater part of those whose industry or\\ncapital is at present engaged in it. The sudden loss of the\\nemployment, even of the ships which import the eighty-two\\nthousand hogsheads of tobacco, which are over and above the\\nconsumption of Great Britain, might alone be felt very sensibly .', 'of considerable scarcity , allowed to enjoy the whole of that growth.\\nThe temporary laws, prohibiting, for a limited time, the exportation\\nof corn, and taking off, for a limited time, the duties upon its\\nimportation, expedients to which Great Britain has been obliged so\\nfrequently to have recourse, sufﬁciently demonstrate the\\nimpropriety of her general system. Had that system been good, she\\nwould not so frequently have been reduced to the necessity of\\ndeparting from it.\\nWere all nations to follow the liberal system of free exportation\\nand free importation, the different states into which a great\\ncontinent was divided, would so far resemble the different\\nprovinces of a great empire. As among the different provinces of a\\ngreat empire, the freedom of the inland trade appears, both from\\nreason and experience, not only the best palliative of a dearth, but\\nthe most effectual preventive of a famine; so would the freedom of\\nthe exportation and importation trade be among the different states', 'They would soon, therefore, rival those mercantile nations in this\\nbranch of foreign trade, and, in due time, would justle them out of\\nit altogether .\\nAccording to this liberal and generous system, therefore, the\\nmost advantageous method in which a landed nation can raise up\\nartiﬁcers, manufacturers, and merchants  of its own, is to grant the\\nmost perfect freedom of trade to the artiﬁcers, manufacturers, and\\nmerchants of all other nations. It thereby raises the value of the\\nsurplus produce of its own land, of which the continual increase\\ngradually establishes a fund, which, in due time, necessarily raises\\nup all the artiﬁcers, manufacturers, and merchants, whom it has\\noccasion for .\\nWhen a landed nation on the contrary , oppresses, either by high\\nduties or by prohibitions, the trade of foreign nations, it necessarily\\nhurts its own interest in two different ways. First, by raising the\\nprice of all foreign goods, and of all sorts of manufactures, it', 'of a nation, in its commercial relations to foreign nations, is, like\\nthat of a merchant with regard to the different people with whom\\nhe deals, to buy as cheap, and to sell as dear as possible. But it will\\nbe most likely to buy cheap, when, by the most perfect freedom of\\ntrade, it encourages all nations to bring to it the goods which it has\\noccasion to purchase; and, for the same reason, it will be most\\nlikely to sell dear, when its markets are thus ﬁlled with the greatest\\nnumber of buyers. The act of navigation, it is true, lays no burden\\nupon foreign ships that come to export the produce of British\\nindustry . Even the ancient aliens duty, which used to be paid upon\\nall goods, exported as well as imported, has, by several subsequent\\nacts, been taken off from the greater part of the articles of\\nexportation. But if foreigners, either by prohibitions or high duties,\\nare hindered from coming to sell, they cannot always afford to', 'countries an advantageous carrying trade, of which Great Britain\\nwas necessarily to be the centre or emporium, as the European\\ncountry into which those commodities were ﬁrst to be imported.\\nThe importation of commodities of the second kind might be so\\nmanaged too, it was supposed, as to interfere, not with the sale of\\nthose of the same kind which were produced at home, but with that\\nof those which were imported from foreign countries; because, by\\nmeans of proper duties, they might be rendered always somewhat1/25/25, 7:29 PM The Wealth of Nations | Project Gutenberg\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ﬁles/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm 393/654', 'of the capital of the country , than what would naturally ﬂow into\\nthem of its own accord.\\nEach of those different branches of trade, however , is not only\\nadvantageous, but necessary and unavoidable, when the course of\\nthings, without any constraint or violence, naturally introduces it.\\nWhen the produce of any particular branch of industry exceeds\\nwhat the demand of the country requires, the surplus must be sent\\nabroad, and exchanged for something for which there is a demand\\nat home. Without such exportation, a part of the productive labour\\nof the country must cease, and the value of its annual produce\\ndiminish. The land and labour of Great Britain produce generally\\nmore corn, woollens, and hardware, than the demand of the home\\nmarket requires. The surplus part of them, therefore, must be sent\\nabroad, and exchanged for something for which there is a demand\\nat home. It is only by means of such exportation, that this surplus\\ncan acquire a value sufﬁcient to compensate the labour and', 'employed in it, is necessarily limited by the value of the surplus\\nproduce of all those distant places within the country which have\\noccasion to exchange their respective productions with one\\nanother; that of the foreign trade of consumption, by the value of\\nthe surplus produce of the whole country , and of what can be\\npurchased with it; that of the carrying trade, by the value of the\\nsurplus produce of all the different countries in the world. Its\\npossible extent, therefore, is in a manner inﬁnite in comparison of\\nthat of the other two, and is capable of absorbing the greatest\\ncapitals.\\nThe consideration of his own private proﬁt is the sole motive\\nwhich determines the owner of any capital to employ it either in\\nagriculture, in manufactures, or in some particular branch of the\\nwholesale or retail trade.

It is only by means of such exportation, that this surplus\\ncan acquire a value sufﬁcient to compensate the labour and\\nexpense of producing it. The neighbour hood of the sea-coast, and\\nthe banks of all navigable rivers, are advantageous situations for\\nindustry , only because they facilitate the exportation and exchange\\nof such surplus produce for something else which is more in\\ndemand there.\\nWhen the foreign goods which are thus purchased with the\\nsurplus produce of domestic industry exceed the demand of the\\nhome market, the surplus part of them must be sent abroad again,\\nand exchanged for something more in demand at home. About\\n96,000 hogsheads of tobacco are annually purchased in Virginia\\nand Maryland with a part of the surplus produce of British\\nindustry . But the demand of Great Britain does not require,\\nperhaps, more than 14,000. If the remaining 82,000, therefore,', 'trade. This greater abundance, as it must necessarily have\\nincreased their enjoyments, so it must likewise have augmented\\ntheir industry . A greater number of new equivalents, of some kind\\nor other , must have been presented to them to be exchanged for the\\nsurplus produce of that industry . A more extensive market must\\nhave been created for that surplus produce, so as to raise its value,\\nand thereby encourage its increase. The mass of commodities\\nannually thrown into the great circle of European commerce, and\\nby its various revolutions annually distributed among all the\\ndifferent nations comprehended within it, must have been\\naugmented by the whole surplus produ ce of America. A greater\\nshare of this greater mass, therefore, is likely to have fallen to each\\nof those nations, to have increased their enjoyments, and\\naugmented their industry .\\nThe exclusive trade of the mother countries tends to diminish, or\\nat least to keep down below what they would otherwise rise to,', 'carried on between any two places, is always advantageous, though\\nnot always equally so, to both.\\nBy advantage or gain, I understand, not the increase of the\\nquantity of gold and silver , but that of the exchangeable value of\\nthe annual produce of the land and labour of the country , or the\\nincrease of the annual revenue of its inhabitants.\\nIf the balance be even, and if the trade between the two places\\nconsist altogether in the exchange of their native commodities,\\nthey will, upon most occasions, not only both gain, but they will\\ngain equally , or very nearly equally; each will, in this case, afford a\\nmarket for a part of the surplus produce of the other; each will\\nreplace a capital which had been employed in raising and\\npreparing for the market this part of the surplus produce of the\\nother , and which had been distributed among, and given revenue\\nand maintenance to, a certain number of its inhabitants. Some part\\nof the inhabitants of each, therefore, will directly derive their', 'commodities dearer , could serve only to sink the real value of the\\nsurplus produce of their own land, with which, or, what comes to\\nthe same thing, with the price of which those commodities are\\npurchased. Such duties could only serve to discourage the increase\\nof that surplus produce, and consequently the improvement and\\ncultivation of their own land. The most effectual expedient, on the\\ncontrary , for raising the value of that surplus produce, for\\nencouraging its increase, and consequently the improvement and\\ncultivation of their own land, would be to allow the most perfect\\nfreedom to the trade of all such mercantile nations.\\nThis perfect freedom of trade would even be the most effectual\\nexpedient for supplying them, in due time, with all the artiﬁcers,\\nmanufacturers, and merchants, whom they wanted at home; and for\\nﬁlling up, in the properest and most advantageous manner , that\\nvery important void which they felt there.\\nThe continual increase of the surplus produce of their land', 'which had before been advanced; it cannot well be doubted, but\\nthat the neat revenue of customs might, after an alteration of this\\nkind, be fully equal to what it had ever been before.\\nIf, by such a change of system, the public revenue suffered no\\nloss, the trade and manufactures of the country would certainly\\ngain a very considerable advantage. The trade in the commodities\\nnot taxed, by far the greatest number would be perfectly free, and\\nmight be carried on to and from all parts of the world with every\\npossible advantage. Among those commodities would be\\ncomprehended all the necessaries of life, and all the materials of\\nmanufacture. So far as the free importation of the necessaries of\\nlife reduced their average money price in the home market, it\\nwould reduce the money price of labour , but without reducing in\\nany respect its real recompence. The value of money is in\\nproportion to the quantity of the necessaries of life which it will', 'ways; ﬁrst, by sinking the real value of its produce, and thereby\\nlowering the rate of its proﬁts; and, secondly, by raising the rate of\\nproﬁt in all other employments. Agriculture is rendered less\\nadvantageous, and trade and manufactures more advantageous,\\nthan they otherwise would be; and every man is tempted by his\\nown interest to turn, as much as he can, both his capital and his\\nindustry from the former to the latter employments.\\nThough, by this oppressive policy , a landed nation should be\\nable to raise up artiﬁcers, manufacturers , and merchants of its own,\\nsomewhat sooner than it could do by the freedom of trade; a\\nmatter , however , which is not a little doubtful; yet it would raise\\nthem up, if one may say so, prematurely , and before it was\\nperfectly ripe for them.

Compare the cultivation\\nof the lands in the neighbourhood of any considerable town, with\\nthat of those which lie at some distance from it, and you will easily\\nsatisfy yourself how much the country is beneﬁted by the\\ncommerce of the town. Among all the absurd speculations that\\nhave been propagated concerning the balance of trade, it has never\\nbeen pretended that either the country loses by its commerce with\\nthe town, or the town by that with the country which maintains it.1/25/25, 7:29 PM The Wealth of Nations | Project Gutenberg\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ﬁles/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm 258/654', 'CHAPTER I.\\nOF THE NA TURAL  PROGRESS OF\\nOPULENCE.\\nThe great commerce of every civilized society is that carried on\\nbetween the inhabitants of the town and those of the country . It\\nconsists in the exchange of rude for manufactured produce, either\\nimmediately , or by the intervention of money , or of some sort of\\npaper which represents money . The country supplies the town with\\nthe means of subsistence and the materials of manufacture. The\\ntown repays this supply , by sending back a part of the\\nmanufactured produce to the inhabitants of the country . The town,\\nin which there neither is nor can be any reproduction of\\nsubstances, may very properly be said to gain its whole wealth and\\nsubsistence from the country . We must not, however , upon this\\naccount, imagine that the gain of the town is the loss of the\\ncountry . The gains of both are mutual and reciprocal, and the\\ndivision of labour is in this, as in all other cases, advantageous to', 'The greater the number and revenue of the inhabitants of the town,\\nthe more extensive is the market which it affords to those of the\\ncountry; and the more extensive that market, it is always the more\\nadvantageous to a great number . The corn which grows within a\\nmile of the town, sells there for the same price with that which\\ncomes from twenty miles distance. But the price of the latter must,\\ngenerally , not only pay the expense of raising it and bringing it to\\nmarket, but afford, too, the ordinary proﬁts of agriculture to the\\nfarmer . The proprietors and cultivators of the country , therefore,\\nwhich lies in the neighbourhood of the town, over and above the\\nordinary proﬁts of agriculture, gain, in the price of what they sell,\\nthe whole value of the carriage of the like produce that is brought\\nfrom more distant parts; and they save, besides, the whole value of\\nthis carriage in the price of what they buy. Compare the cultivation', 'the most effectual preventive of a famine; so would the freedom of\\nthe exportation and importation trade be among the different states\\ninto which a great continent was divided. The larger the continent,\\nthe easier the communication through all the different parts of it,\\nboth by land and by water , the less would any one particular part of\\nit ever be exposed to either of these calamities, the scarcity of any\\none country being more likely to be relieved by the plenty of some\\nother . But very few countries have entirely adopted this liberal\\nsystem. The freedom of the corn trade is almost everywhere more\\nor less restrained, and in many countries is conﬁned by such\\nabsurd regulations, as frequently aggravate the unavoidable\\nmisfortune of a dearth into the dreadful calamity of a famine. The\\ndemand of such countries for corn may frequently become so great\\nand so urgent, that a small state in their neighbourhood, which\\nhappened at the same time to be labouring under some degree of', 'above it, foreign corn could have been imported, either duty free,\\nor upon paying only a small duty, it might have been exported\\nagain, with the beneﬁt of the bounty , to the great loss of the public\\nrevenue, and to the entire perversion of the institution, of which\\nthe object was to extend the market for the home growth, not that\\nfor the growth of foreign countries.\\nIII. The trade of the merchant-export er of corn for foreign\\nconsumption, certainly does not contribute directly to the plentiful\\nsupply of the home market. It does so, however , indirectly . From\\nwhatever source this supply maybe usually drawn, whether from\\nhome growth, or from foreign importa tion, unless more corn is\\neither usually grown, or usually impor ted into the country , than\\nwhat is usually consumed in it, the supp ly of the home market can\\nnever be very plentiful. But unless the surplus can, in all ordinary\\ncases, be exported, the growers will be careful never to grow more,', 'When the government, in order to remedy the inconveniencies\\nof a dearth, orders all the dealers to sell their corn at what it\\nsupposes a reasonable price, it either hinders them from bringing it\\nto market, which may sometimes produce a famine even in the\\nbeginning of the season; or, if they bring it thither , it enables the\\npeople, and thereby encourages them to consume it so fast as must\\nnecessarily produce a famine before the end of the season. The\\nunlimited, unrestrained freedom of the corn trade, as it is the only\\neffectual preventive of the miseries of a famine, so it is the best\\npalliative of the inconveniencies of a dearth; for the\\ninconveniencies of a real scarcity cannot be remedied; they can\\nonly be palliated. No trade deserves more the full protection of the\\nlaw, and no trade requires it so much; because no trade is so much\\nexposed to popular odium.\\nIn years of scarcity , the inferior ranks of people impute their\\ndistress to the avarice of the corn merchant, who becomes the', 'which would suffer the most by this freedom of trade, and after it\\nthe linen, though the latter much less than the former .\\nSecondly , Though a great number of people should, by thus\\nrestoring the freedom of trade, be thrown all at once out of their\\nordinary employment and common method of subsistence, it\\nwould by no means follow that they would thereby be deprived\\neither of employment or subsistence. By the reduction of the army\\nand navy at the end of the late war, more  than 100,000 soldiers and\\nseamen, a number equal to what is employed in the greatest\\nmanufactures, were all at once throw n out of their ordinary\\nemployment: but though they no doubt suffered some\\ninconveniency , they were not thereby deprived of all employment\\nand subsistence. The greater part of the seamen, it is probable,\\ngradually betook themselves to the merc hant service as they could\\nﬁnd occasion, and in the mean time both they and the soldiers were', 'would seldom affect them considerably , but some other\\nmanufacture of theirs. This may, no doubt, give encouragement to\\nsome particular class of workmen among ourselves, and, by\\nexcluding some of their rivals, may enable them to raise their price\\nin the home market. Those workmen however , who suffered by our\\nneighbours prohibition, will not be beneﬁted by ours. On the\\ncontrary , they, and almost all the other classes of our citizens, will\\nthereby be obliged to pay dearer than before for certain goods.\\nEvery such law, therefore, imposes a real tax upon the whole\\ncountry , not in favour of that particular class of workmen who\\nwere injured by our neighbours prohibitions, but of some other\\nclass.\\nThe case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation,\\nhow far, or in what manner , it is proper to restore the free\\nimportation of foreign goods, after it has been for some time\\ninterrupted, is when particular manufactures, by means of high', 'and they furnish the cultivators with something in exchange for it\\nthat is either useful or agreeable to them, upon easier terms than\\nthey could have obtained it before. The cultivators get a better\\nprice for their surplus produce, and can purchase cheaper other\\nconveniencies which they have occasion for. They are thus both\\nencouraged and enabled to increase this surplus produce by a\\nfurther improvement and better cultivation of the land; and as the\\nfertility of the land had given birth to the manufacture, so the\\nprogress of the manufacture re-acts upon the land, and increases1/25/25, 7:29 PM The Wealth of Nations | Project Gutenberg\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ﬁles/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm 276/654', 'consequence of the extension and improvement of agriculture, the\\nlast and greatest effect of foreign commerce, and of the\\nmanufactures immediately introduced by it, and which I shall now\\nproceed to explain.1/25/25, 7:29 PM The Wealth of Nations | Project Gutenberg\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ﬁles/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm 277/654', 'else for which there is a demand.

The former are\\nalways and necessarily beneﬁcial; the latter always and necessarily\\nhurtful. But the former are so beneﬁcial, that the colony trade,\\nthough subject to a monopoly , and, notwithstanding the hurtful\\neffects of that monopoly , is still, upon the whole, beneﬁcial, and\\ngreatly beneﬁcial, though a good deal less so than it otherwise\\nwould be.\\nThe effect of the colony trade, in its natural and free state, is to\\nopen a great though distant market, for such parts of the produce of\\nBritish industry as may exceed the demand of the markets nearer\\nhome, of those of Europe, and of the countries which lie round the\\nMediterranean sea. In its natural and free state, the colony trade,\\nwithout drawing from those markets any part of the produce which\\nhad ever been sent to them, encourages Great Britain to increase', 'Drawbacks, however , it must always be understood, are useful\\nonly in those cases in which the goods, for the exportation of\\nwhich they are given, are really exported to some foreign country ,\\nand not clandestinely re-imported into our own. That some\\ndrawbacks, particularly those upon tobacco, have frequently been\\nabused in this manner , and have given occasion to many frauds,\\nequally hurtful both to the revenue and to the fair trader , is well\\nknown.1/25/25, 7:29 PM The Wealth of Nations | Project Gutenberg\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ﬁles/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm 340/654', 'to stop the clamorous complaints of our merchants and\\nmanufacturers, that they will be underso ld at home, to lay a much\\nheavier duty upon the importation of all foreign goods of the same\\nkind.\\nThis second limitation of the freedom of trade, according to\\nsome people, should, upon most occasions, be extended much\\nfarther than to the precise foreign commodities which could come\\ninto competition with those which had been taxed at home.
