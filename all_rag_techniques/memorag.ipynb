    "# MemoRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Memory Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "MemoRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that incorporates a memory model as an auxiliary step before the retrieval phase. In doing so, it bridges the gap in contextual understanding and reasoning that standard RAG techniques face when addressing queries with implicit or ambiguous information needs and unstructured external knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Standard RAG techniques rely heavily on lexical or semantic matching between the query and the knowledge base. While this approach works well for clear question answering tasks with structured knowledge, it often falls short when handling queries with implicit or ambiguous information (e.g., describing the relationships between main characters in a novel) or when the knowledge base is unstructured (e.g., fiction books). In such cases, lexical or semantic matching seldom produces the desired outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. **Memory**: A compressed representation of the database created by a long-context model, designed to handle and summarize extensive inputs efficiently.\n",
    "2. **Retriever**: A standard RAG retrieval model responsible for selecting relevant context from the knowledge base to support the generator.\n",
    "3. **Generator**: A generative language model that produces responses by combining the query with the retrieved context, similar to standard RAG setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "### 1. Memory\n",
    "- The memory module serves as an auxiliary component to enhance the retriever’s ability to identify better matches between queries and relevant parts of the database. It takes the original query and the database as inputs and produces staging answers — intermediate outputs like clues, surrogate queries, or key points — which the retriever uses instead of the original query.\n",
    "- Long-term memory is constructed by running a long-context model, such as Qwen2-7B-Instruct or Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, over the entire database. This process generates a compressed representation of the database through an attention mechanism.\n",
    "- The compressed representation is stored as key-value pairs (kv-cache), facilitating efficient and accurate retrieval.\n",
    "- Released memory models include memorag-qwen2-7b-inst and memorag-mistral-7b-inst, derived from Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Retriever\n",
    "- The retriever is a standard retrieval model, adapted to take processed queries (created by the memory module as staging answers) instead of the original query.\n",
    "- It outputs the retrieved **context**, which serves as the basis for generating the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Generator\n",
    "- The generator produces the final response by combining the retriever’s output (retrieved context) with the original query.\n",
    "- MemoRAG ensures compatibility and consistency by using the memory module’s underlying model as the default generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of the Approach\n",
    "1. **Extended Scope of Queries:** MemoRAG's preprocessing capabilities enable it to handle complex and long-context tasks that conventional RAG methods struggle with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Accuracy:** By simplifying and adjusting queries before retrieval, MemoRAG enhances performance over standard RAG methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility:** Adapts to diverse tasks, datasets, and retrieval scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Robustness:** Improved performance remains consistent across various generators, datasets, and query types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Efficiency**: The use of key-value compression reduces computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The memory module in MemoRAG significantly enhances comprehension of both the queries and the database, enabling more effective retrieval. Its ability to preprocess queries, generate staging answers, and leverage long-context memory models ensures high-quality responses, making MemoRAG a significant step forward in the evolution of retrieval-augmented generation.\n"

During the Holocene epoch, which \\nbegan at the end of the last ice age, human societies f lourished, but the industrial era has seen \\nunprecedented changes.  \\nModern Observations  \\nModern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \\nand extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \\ndocumented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \\nprovide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and \\npredict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily \\ndriven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhou se gases.  \\nChapter 2: Causes of Climate Change  \\nGreenhouse Gases\", 'Understanding Climate Change  \\nChapter 1: Introduction to Climate Change  \\nClimate change refers to significant, long -term changes in the global climate. The term \\n\"global climate\" encompasses the planet\\'s overall weather patterns, including temperature, \\nprecipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past cent ury, human \\nactivities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \\ncontributed to climate change.  \\nHistorical Context  \\nThe Earth\\'s climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \\nbeen seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \\n11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and  human civilization. \\nMost of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\\'s orbit that \\nchange the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which', 'Changing Seasons  \\nClimate change is altering the timing and length of seasons, affecting ecosystems and human \\nactivities. For example, spring is arriving earlier, and winters are becoming shorter and \\nmilder in many regions. This shift disrupts plant and animal life cycles a nd agricultural \\npractices.  \\nMelting Ice and Rising Sea Levels  \\nWarmer temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising \\nsea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the past century, \\nthreatening coastal communities and ecosystems.  \\nPolar Ice Melt', 'The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate, leading to significant ice \\nloss. Antarctic ice sheets are also losing mass, contributing to sea level rise. This melting \\naffects global ocean currents and weather patterns.  \\nGlacial Retreat  \\nGlaciers around the world are retreating, affecting water supplies for millions of people. \\nRegions dependent on glacial meltwater, such as the Himalayas and the Andes, face \\nparticular risks. Glacial melt also impacts hydropower generation and agriculture.  \\nCoastal Erosion  \\nRising sea levels and increased storm surges are accelerating coastal erosion, threatening \\nhomes, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Low -lying islands and coastal regions are especially \\nvulnerable. Coastal communities must invest in adaptation measures like s ea walls and \\nmanaged retreats.  \\nExtreme Weather Events  \\nClimate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather', 'driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhou se gases.  \\nChapter 2: Causes of Climate Change  \\nGreenhouse Gases  \\nThe primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \\natmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \\noxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is  essential \\nfor life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \\nactivities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate.  \\nFossil Fuels  \\nBurning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and \\nnatural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked \\nthe beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise \\ntoday.  \\nCoal']\n",

He suggests that when individuals seek to improve their own conditions, they inadvertently promote the general interest of society. For instance, the competition among traders and artisans to regulate their markets can lead to a more efficient allocation of resources, which ultimately benefits everyone. Additionally, improvements in the circumstances of the lower ranks of society are seen as advantageous to the whole, as a flourishing society cannot thrive if the majority are poor and miserable. Thus, self-interest and societal good are interconnected, with the former often leading to the latter.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Public Prejudices and Private Interests**: There are strong public prejudices and private interests that oppose the restoration of free trade, making it difficult to achieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Monopolies and Regulations**: The mercantile system introduces dangerous disorders into the economy, with monopolies forcing capital away from more beneficial trades and creating inefficiencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **National Prejudice and Animosity**: Trade is often hindered by national prejudices and animosities, leading to discord rather than cooperation among trading nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Obstruction of Communication**: Geographic limitations, such as the lack of navigable rivers and seas in certain regions, can obstruct trade and communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Economic Disruption**: Sudden changes in trade regulations can lead to significant economic distress and disorder, particularly for manufacturers reliant on specific markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Competition and Profit Rates**: The monopoly of certain trades can keep profit rates artificially high, reducing competition and leading to relative disadvantages in other branches of trade.\n",

      "These challenges create a complex environment for trade that can lead to inefficiencies and conflicts.\n",

But after the division of labour has\\nonce thoroughly taken place, it is but a very small part of these\\nwith which a man’ s own labour can supply him. The far greater\\npart of them he must derive from the labour of other people, and he\\nmust be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labour which\\nhe can command, or which he can afford to purchase. The value of\\nany commodity , therefore, to the person  who possesses it, and who\\nmeans not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for\\nother commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it\\nenables him to purchase or command. Labour therefore, is the real\\nmeasure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.', 'that cheap which is to be had easily , or with very little labour .\\nLabour alone, therefore, never varying in its own value, is alone\\nthe ultimate and real standard by which the value of all\\ncommodities can at all times and places be estimated and\\ncompared. It is their real price; money is their nominal price only .\\nBut though equal quantities of labour are always of equal value\\nto the labourer , yet to the person who employs him they appear\\nsometimes to be of greater , and sometimes of smaller value. He\\npurchases them sometimes with a greater , and sometimes with a\\nsmaller quantity of goods, and to him the price of labour seems to\\nvary like that of all other things. It appears to him dear in the one\\ncase, and cheap in the other . In reality , however , it is the goods\\nwhich are cheap in the one case, and dear in the other .\\nIn this popular sense, therefore, labour , like commodities, may\\nbe said to have a real and a nominal price. Its real price may be', 'there very high, but that the real value of those commodities is\\nvery low .\\nLabour , it must always be remembered, and not any particular\\ncommodity , or set of commodities, is the real measure of the value\\nboth of silver and of all other commodities.\\nBut in countries almost waste, or but thinly inhabited, cattle,\\npoultry , game of all kinds, etc. as they are the spontaneous\\nproductions of Nature, so she frequently produces them in much\\ngreater quantities than the consumption of the inhabitants requires.\\nIn such a state of things, the suppl y commonly exceeds the\\ndemand. In different states of socie ty, in different states of\\nimprovement, therefore, such commodities will represent, or be\\nequivalent, to very dif ferent quantities of labour .\\nIn every state of society , in every stage of improvement, corn is\\nthe production of human industry .

We must in this case\\ncompare, not so much the different quantities of silver for which it\\nwas commonly sold, as the different quantities or labour which\\nthose different quantities of silver could have purchased. But the\\ncurrent prices of labour , at distant times and places, can scarce ever\\nbe known with any degree of exactness.

He emphasizes that when proper subjects of taxation are exhausted, governments may resort to improper ones in cases of urgent necessity. He also notes that a well-structured tax system should minimize the burden on the people while ensuring that the revenue collected is sufficient for the state's needs. Additionally, he argues that taxes should be certain, convenient, and equitable to avoid undue hardship on contributors.\n",

He supplies the far greater\\npart of them by exchanging that surplus part of the produce of his\\nown labour , which is over and above his own consumption, for\\nsuch parts of the produce of other men’ s labour as he has occasion\\nfor. Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes, in some\\nmeasure, a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is\\nproperly a commercial society .\\nBut when the division of labour ﬁrst began to take place, this\\npower of exchanging must frequently have been very much\\nclogged and embarrassed in its operations.

We are more industrious than our\\nforefathers, because, in the present times, the funds destined for the\\nmaintenance of industry are much greater in proportion to those\\nwhich are likely to be employed in the maintenance of idleness,\\nthan they were two or three centuries ago.

The number of useful and\\nproductive labourers, it will hereafter appear , is everywhere in\\nproportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in\\nsetting them to work, and to the particular way in which it is so\\nemployed. The second book, therefore, treats of the nature of\\ncapital stock, of the manner in which it is gradually accumulated,\\nand of the different quantities of labour which it puts into motion,\\naccording to the dif ferent ways in which it is employed.\\nNations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity , and\\njudgment, in the application of labour , have followed very different\\nplans in the general conduct or direction of it; and those plans have\\nnot all been equally favourable to the greatness of its produce.

Its followers are very numerous; and as men\\nare fond of paradoxes, and of appearing to understand what\\nsurpasses the comprehensions of ordinary people, the paradox\\nwhich it maintains, concerning the unproductive nature of\\nmanufacturing labour , has not, perhaps, contributed a little to\\nincrease the number of its admirers.

Their works', 'species, but only continued it as it was before. Farmers and\\ncountry labourers, indeed, over and above the stock which\\nmaintains and employs them, reproduce annually a neat produce, a\\nfree rent to the landlord. As a marriage which affords three\\nchildren is certainly more productive than one which affords only\\ntwo, so the labour of farmers and country labourers is certainly\\nmore productive than that of merchants, artiﬁcers, and\\nmanufacturers. The superior produce of the one class, however ,\\ndoes not, render the other barren or unproductive.\\nSecondly , it seems, on this account, altogether improper to\\nconsider artiﬁcers, manufacturers, and merchants, in the same light\\nas menial servants. The labour of menial servants does not\\ncontinue the existence of the fund which maintains and employs\\nthem.

That work consists in services', 'even the common workman, if his wages are considerable, may\\nmaintain a menial servant; or he may sometimes go to a play or a\\npuppet-show , and so contribute his share towards maintaining one\\nset of unproductive labourers; or he may pay some taxes, and thus\\nhelp to maintain another set, more honourable and useful, indeed,\\nbut equally unproductive.

Nations, accordingly , seldom fail to\\nretaliate in this manner . The French have been particularly forward\\nto favour their own manufactures, by restraining the importation of\\nsuch foreign goods as could come into competition with them.

The gains of both are mutual and reciprocal, and the\\ndivision of labour is in this, as in all other cases, advantageous to\\nall the different persons employed in the various occupations into\\nwhich it is subdivided. The inhabitants of the country purchase of\\nthe town a greater quantity of manufactured goods with the\\nproduce of a much smaller quantity of their own labour , than they\\nmust have employed had they attempted to prepare them\\nthemselves. The town affords a market for the surplus produce of\\nthe country , or what is over and abov e the maintenance of the\\ncultivators; and it is there that the inhabitants of the country\\nexchange it for something else which is in demand among them.\\nThe greater the number and revenue of the inhabitants of the town,\\nthe more extensive is the market which it affords to those of the\\ncountry; and the more extensive that market, it is always the more', 'procure to them; yet, even upon this supposition, the revenue of a\\ntrading and manufacturing country must, other things being equal,\\nalways be much greater than that of one without trade or\\nmanufactures. By means of trade and manufactures, a greater\\nquantity of subsistence can be annually imported into a particular\\ncountry , than what its own lands, in the actual state of their\\ncultivation, could afford. The inhabitants of a town, though they\\nfrequently possess no lands of their own, yet draw to themselves,\\nby their industry , such a quantity of the rude produce of the lands\\nof other people, as supplies them, not only with the materials of\\ntheir work, but with the fund of their subsistence. What a town\\nalways is with regard to the country in its neighbourhood, one\\nindependent state or country may frequently be with regard to\\nother independent states or countries. It is thus that Holland draws\\na great part of its subsistence from other countries; live cattle from', 'the most effectual preventive of a famine; so would the freedom of\\nthe exportation and importation trade be among the different states\\ninto which a great continent was divided. The larger the continent,\\nthe easier the communication through all the different parts of it,\\nboth by land and by water , the less would any one particular part of\\nit ever be exposed to either of these calamities, the scarcity of any\\none country being more likely to be relieved by the plenty of some\\nother . But very few countries have entirely adopted this liberal\\nsystem. The freedom of the corn trade is almost everywhere more\\nor less restrained, and in many countries is conﬁned by such\\nabsurd regulations, as frequently aggravate the unavoidable\\nmisfortune of a dearth into the dreadful calamity of a famine. The\\ndemand of such countries for corn may frequently become so great\\nand so urgent, that a small state in their neighbourhood, which\\nhappened at the same time to be labouring under some degree of', 'above it, foreign corn could have been imported, either duty free,\\nor upon paying only a small duty, it might have been exported\\nagain, with the beneﬁt of the bounty , to the great loss of the public\\nrevenue, and to the entire perversion of the institution, of which\\nthe object was to extend the market for the home growth, not that\\nfor the growth of foreign countries.\\nIII. The trade of the merchant-export er of corn for foreign\\nconsumption, certainly does not contribute directly to the plentiful\\nsupply of the home market. It does so, however , indirectly . From\\nwhatever source this supply maybe usually drawn, whether from\\nhome growth, or from foreign importa tion, unless more corn is\\neither usually grown, or usually impor ted into the country , than\\nwhat is usually consumed in it, the supp ly of the home market can\\nnever be very plentiful. But unless the surplus can, in all ordinary\\ncases, be exported, the growers will be careful never to grow more,', 'When the government, in order to remedy the inconveniencies\\nof a dearth, orders all the dealers to sell their corn at what it\\nsupposes a reasonable price, it either hinders them from bringing it\\nto market, which may sometimes produce a famine even in the\\nbeginning of the season; or, if they bring it thither , it enables the\\npeople, and thereby encourages them to consume it so fast as must\\nnecessarily produce a famine before the end of the season. The\\nunlimited, unrestrained freedom of the corn trade, as it is the only\\neffectual preventive of the miseries of a famine, so it is the best\\npalliative of the inconveniencies of a dearth; for the\\ninconveniencies of a real scarcity cannot be remedied; they can\\nonly be palliated. No trade deserves more the full protection of the\\nlaw, and no trade requires it so much; because no trade is so much\\nexposed to popular odium.\\nIn years of scarcity , the inferior ranks of people impute their\\ndistress to the avarice of the corn merchant, who becomes the', 'which would suffer the most by this freedom of trade, and after it\\nthe linen, though the latter much less than the former .\\nSecondly , Though a great number of people should, by thus\\nrestoring the freedom of trade, be thrown all at once out of their\\nordinary employment and common method of subsistence, it\\nwould by no means follow that they would thereby be deprived\\neither of employment or subsistence. By the reduction of the army\\nand navy at the end of the late war, more  than 100,000 soldiers and\\nseamen, a number equal to what is employed in the greatest\\nmanufactures, were all at once throw n out of their ordinary\\nemployment: but though they no doubt suffered some\\ninconveniency , they were not thereby deprived of all employment\\nand subsistence.

Those workmen however , who suffered by our\\nneighbours prohibition, will not be beneﬁted by ours. On the\\ncontrary , they, and almost all the other classes of our citizens, will\\nthereby be obliged to pay dearer than before for certain goods.\\nEvery such law, therefore, imposes a real tax upon the whole\\ncountry , not in favour of that particular class of workmen who\\nwere injured by our neighbours prohibitions, but of some other\\nclass.\\nThe case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation,\\nhow far, or in what manner , it is proper to restore the free\\nimportation of foreign goods, after it has been for some time\\ninterrupted, is when particular manufactures, by means of high', 'and they furnish the cultivators with something in exchange for it\\nthat is either useful or agreeable to them, upon easier terms than\\nthey could have obtained it before.

Its rude produce\\nbeing charged with less carriage, the traders could pay the growers', 'Even the regulations by which each nation endeavours to secure\\nto itself the exclusive trade of its own colonies, are frequently\\nmore hurtful to the countries in favour of which they are\\nestablished, than to those against which  they are established. The\\nunjust oppression of the industry of other countries falls back, if I\\nmay say so, upon the heads of the oppressors, and crushes their\\nindustry more than it does that of those other countries. By those\\nregulations, for example, the merchant of Hambur g must send the\\nlinen which he destines for the American market to London, and he\\nmust bring back from thence the tobacco which he destines for the\\nGerman market; because he can neithe r send the one directly to\\nAmerica, nor bring the other directly from thence. By this restraint\\nhe is probably obliged to sell the one somewhat cheaper , and to\\nbuy the other somewhat dearer , than he otherwise might have\\ndone; and his proﬁts are probably somewhat abridged by means of', 'two countries lies, or which of them exports to the greatest value.\\nNational prejudice and animosity , prompted always by the private\\ninterest of particular traders, are the principles which generally\\ndirect our judgment upon all questions concerning it. There are two\\ncriterions, however , which have frequently been appealed to upon\\nsuch occasions, the custom-house books and the course of\\nexchange. The custom-house books, I think, it is now generally\\nacknowledged, are a very uncertain criterion, on account of the\\ninaccuracy of the valuation at which the greater part of goods are\\nrated in them. The course of exchange is, perhaps, almost equally\\nso.\\nWhen the exchange between two places, such as London and\\nParis, is at par, it is said to be a sign that the debts due from\\nLondon to Paris are compensated by those due from Paris to\\nLondon. On the contrary , when a premium is paid at London for a\\nbill upon Paris, it is said to be a sign that the debts due from', 'end to almost all fair commerce between the two nations; and\\nsmugglers are now the principal importers, either of British goods\\ninto France, or of French goods into Great Britain. The principles\\nwhich I have been examining, in the foregoing chapter , took their\\norigin from private interest and the spirit of monopoly; those\\nwhich I am going te examine in this, from national prejudice and\\nanimosity . They are, accordingly , as might well be expected, still\\nmore unreasonable. They are so, even upon the principles of the\\ncommercial system.\\nFirst, Though it were certain that in the case of a free trade\\nbetween France and England, for example, the balance would be in\\nfavour of France, it would by no means follow that such a trade\\nwould be disadvantageous to England, or that the general balance\\nof its whole trade would thereby be turned more against it. If the\\nwines of France are better and cheaper than those of Portugal, or\\nits linens than those of Germany , it would be more advantageous', 'consequence of the extension of agric ulture, the land of every\\ncountry produces a much greater quan tity of vegetable than of\\nanimal food, and the labourer everywh ere lives chieﬂy upon the\\nwholesome food that is cheapest and most abundant.

Those theories have had a considerable influence, not only upon the opinions of men of learning, but upon the public conduct of princes and sovereign states. I have endeavoured, in the fourth book, to explain as fully and distinctly as I can those different theories, and the principal effects which they have produced in different ages and nations. </p> <p> To explain in what has consisted the revenue of the great body of the people, or what has been the nature of those funds, which, in different ages and nations, have supplied their annual consumption, is the object of these four first books. The fifth and last book treats of the revenue of the sovereign, or commonwealth.', 'That which arises from the more solid improvements of agriculture is much more durable, and cannot be destroyed but by those more violent convulsions occasioned by the depredations of hostile and barbarous nations continued for a century or two together; such as those that happened for some time before and after the fall of the Roman empire in the western provinces of Europe. </p> </div><!--end chapter--> <div class=\"chapter\"> <h2><a id=\"chap25\"></a>BOOK IV.<br> OF SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY.</h2> <p> Political economy, considered as a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator, proposes two distinct objects; first, to provide a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people, or, more properly, to enable them to provide such a revenue or subsistence for themselves; and, secondly, to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue sufficient for the public services. It proposes to enrich both the people and the sovereign. </p> <p> The different progress of opulence in different ages and nations, has given occasion to two different systems of political economy, with regard to enriching the people. The one may be called the system of commerce, the other that of agriculture. I shall endeavour to explain both as fully and distinctly as I can, and shall begin with the system of commerce. It is the modern system, and is best understood in our own country and in our own times. </p> </div><!--end chapter--> <div class=\"chapter\"> <h2><a id=\"chap26\"></a>CHAPTER I.<br> OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE COMMERCIAL OR MERCANTILE SYSTEM.</h2> <p> That wealth consists in money, or in gold and silver, is a popular notion which naturally arises from the double function of money, as the instrument of commerce, and as the measure of value. In consequence of its being the instrument of commerce, when we have money we can more readily obtain whatever else we have occasion for, than by means of any other commodity. The great affair, we always find, is to get money. When that is obtained, there is no difficulty in making any subsequent purchase. In consequence of its being the measure of value, we estimate that of all other commodities by the quantity of money which they will exchange for.']\n",

The number of useful and productive labourers, it will hereafter appear, is everywhere in proportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in setting them to work, and to the particular way in which it is so employed. The second book, therefore, treats of the nature of capital stock, of the manner in which it is gradually accumulated, and of the different quantities of labour which it puts into motion, according to the different ways in which it is employed. </p> <p> Nations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity, and judgment, in the application of labour, have followed very different plans in the general conduct or direction of it; and those plans have not all been equally favourable to the greatness of its produce.

Scarce any nation has dealt equally and impartially with every sort of industry. Since the down-fall of the Roman empire, the policy of Europe has been more favourable to arts, manufactures, and commerce, the industry of towns, than to agriculture, the Industry of the country.', 'Whenever he employs any part of it in maintaining unproductive hands of any kind, that part is from that moment withdrawn from his capital, and placed in his stock reserved for immediate consumption. </p> <p> Unproductive labourers, and those who do not labour at all, are all maintained by revenue; either, first, by that part of the annual produce which is originally destined for constituting a revenue to some particular persons, either as the rent of land, or as the profits of stock; or, secondly, by that part which, though originally destined for replacing a capital, and for maintaining productive labourers only, yet when it comes into their hands, whatever part of it is over and above their necessary subsistence, may be employed in maintaining indifferently either productive or unproductive hands. Thus, not only the great landlord or the rich merchant, but even the common workman, if his wages are considerable, may maintain a menial servant; or he may sometimes go to a play or a puppet-show, and so contribute his share towards maintaining one set of unproductive labourers; or he may pay some taxes, and thus help to maintain another set, more honourable and useful, indeed, but equally unproductive. No part of the annual produce, however, which had been originally destined to replace a capital, is ever directed towards maintaining unproductive hands, till after it has put into motion its full complement of productive labour, or all that it could put into motion in the way in which it was employed. The workman must have earned his wages by work done, before he can employ any part of them in this manner. That part, too, is generally but a small one. It is his spare revenue only, of which productive labourers have seldom a great deal. They generally have some, however; and in the payment of taxes, the greatness of their number may compensate, in some measure, the smallness of their contribution. The rent of land and the profits of stock are everywhere, therefore, the principal sources from which unproductive hands derive their subsistence. These are the two sorts of revenue of which the owners have generally most to spare. They might both maintain indifferently, either productive or unproductive hands. They seem, however, to have some predilection for the latter. The expense of a great lord feeds generally more idle than industrious people.', 'The rich merchant, though with his capital he maintains industrious people only, yet by his expense, that is, by the employment of his revenue, he feeds commonly the very same sort as the great lord. </p> <p> The proportion, therefore, between the productive and unproductive hands, depends very much in every country upon the proportion between that part of the annual produce, which, as soon as it comes either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, is destined for replacing a capital, and that which is destined for constituting a revenue, either as rent or as profit. This proportion is very different in rich from what it is in poor countries. </p> <p> Thus, at present, in the opulent countries of Europe, a very large, frequently the largest, portion of the produce of the land, is destined for replacing the capital of the rich and independent farmer; the other for paying his profits, and the rent of the landlord. But anciently, during the prevalency of the feudal government, a very small portion of the produce was sufficient to replace the capital employed in cultivation. It consisted commonly in a few wretched cattle, maintained altogether by the spontaneous produce of uncultivated land, and which might, therefore, be considered as a part of that spontaneous produce. It generally, too, belonged to the landlord, and was by him advanced to the occupiers of the land. All the rest of the produce properly belonged to him too, either as rent for his land, or as profit upon this paltry capital. The occupiers of land were generally bond-men, whose persons and effects were equally his property. Those who were not bond-men were tenants at will; and though the rent which they paid was often nominally little more than a quit-rent, it really amounted to the whole produce of the land. Their lord could at all times command their labour in peace and their service in war. Though they lived at a distance from his house, they were equally dependent upon him as his retainers who lived in it. But the whole produce of the land undoubtedly belongs to him, who can dispose of the labour and service of all those whom it maintains. In the present state of Europe, the share of the landlord seldom exceeds a third, sometimes not a fourth part of the whole produce of the land.']\n",

After agriculture, the capital employed in manufactures puts into motion the greatest quantity of productive labour, and adds the greatest value to the annual produce. That which is employed in the trade of exportation has the least effect of any of the three. </p> <p> The country, indeed, which has not capital sufficient for all those three purposes, has not arrived at that degree of opulence for which it seems naturally destined. To attempt, however, prematurely, and with an insufficient capital, to do all the three, is certainly not the shortest way for a society, no more than it would be for an individual, to acquire a sufficient one. The capital of all the individuals of a nation has its limits, in the same manner as that of a single individual, and is capable of executing only certain purposes. The capital of all the individuals of a nation is increased in the same manner as that of a single individual, by their continually accumulating and adding to it whatever they save out of their revenue. It is likely to increase the fastest, therefore, when it is employed in the way that affords the greatest revenue to all the inhabitants or the country, as they will thus be enabled to make the greatest savings. But the revenue of all the inhabitants of the country is necessarily in proportion to the value of the annual produce of their land and labour. </p> <p> It has been the principal cause of the rapid progress of our American colonies towards wealth and greatness, that almost their whole capitals have hitherto been employed in agriculture. They have no manufactures, those household and coarser manufactures excepted, which necessarily accompany the progress of agriculture, and which are the work of the women and children in every private family. The greater part, both of the exportation and coasting trade of America, is carried on by the capitals of merchants who reside in Great Britain.', 'As in a well ordered state of things, therefore, those ground expenses, over and above reproducing in the completest manner their own value, occasion likewise, after a certain time, a reproduction of a neat produce, they are in this system considered as productive expenses. </p> <p> The ground expenses of the landlord, however, together with the original and the annual expenses of the farmer, are the only three sorts of expenses which in this system are considered as productive. All other expenses, and all other orders of people, even those who, in the common apprehensions of men, are regarded as the most productive, are, in this account of things, represented as altogether barren and unproductive. </p> <p> Artificers and manufacturers, in particular, whose industry, in the common apprehensions of men, increases so much the value of the rude produce of land, are in this system represented as a class of people altogether barren and unproductive. Their labour, it is said, replaces only the stock which employs them, together with its ordinary profits. That stock consists in the materials, tools, and wages, advanced to them by their employer; and is the fund destined for their employment and maintenance. Its profits are the fund destined for the maintenance of their employer. Their employer, as he advances to them the stock of materials, tools, and wages, necessary for their employment, so he advances to himself what is necessary for his own maintenance; and this maintenance he generally proportions to the profit which he expects to make by the price of their work. Unless its price repays to him the maintenance which he advances to himself, as well as the materials, tools, and wages, which he advances to his workmen, it evidently does not repay to him the whole expense which he lays out upon it. The profits of manufacturing stock, therefore, are not, like the rent of land, a neat produce which remains after completely repaying the whole expense which must be laid out in order to obtain them. The stock of the farmer yields him a profit, as well as that of the master manufacturer; and it yields a rent likewise to another person, which that of the master manufacturer does not. The expense, therefore, laid out in employing and maintaining artificers and manufacturers, does no more than continue, if one may say so, the existence of its own value, and does not produce any new value. It is, therefore, altogether a barren and unproductive expense.', 'We should not call a marriage barren or unproductive, though it produced only a son and a daughter, to replace the father and mother, and though it did not increase the number of the human species, but only continued it as it was before. Farmers and country labourers, indeed, over and above the stock which maintains and employs them, reproduce annually a neat produce, a free rent to the landlord. As a marriage which affords three children is certainly more productive than one which affords only two, so the labour of farmers and country labourers is certainly more productive than that of merchants, artificers, and manufacturers. The superior produce of the one class, however, does not, render the other barren or unproductive. </p> <p> Secondly, it seems, on this account, altogether improper to consider artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, in the same light as menial servants. The labour of menial servants does not continue the existence of the fund which maintains and employs them. Their maintenance and employment is altogether at the expense of their masters, and the work which they perform is not of a nature to repay that expense. That work consists in services which perish generally in the very instant of their performance, and does not fix or realize itself in any vendible commodity, which can replace the value of their wages and maintenance. The labour, on the contrary, of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, naturally does fix and realize itself in some such vendible commodity. It is upon this account that, in the chapter in which I treat of productive and unproductive labour, I have classed artificers, manufacturers, and merchants among the productive labourers, and menial servants among the barren or unproductive. </p> <p> Thirdly, it seems, upon every supposition, improper to say, that the labour of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, does not increase the real revenue of the society. Though we should suppose, for example, as it seems to be supposed in this system, that the value of the daily, monthly, and yearly consumption of this class was exactly equal to that of its daily, monthly, and yearly production; yet it would not from thence follow, that its labour added nothing to the real revenue, to the real value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the society.']\n",

The value of any commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities. </p> <p> The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it and who wants to dispose of it, or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people. What is bought with money, or with goods, is purchased by labour, as much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body. That money, or those goods, indeed, save us this toil. They contain the value of a certain quantity of labour, which we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain the value of an equal quantity. Labour was the first price, the original purchase money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world was originally purchased; and its value, to those who possess it, and who want to exchange it for some new productions, is precisely equal to the quantity of labour which it can enable them to purchase or command. </p> <p> Wealth, as Mr Hobbes says, is power. But the person who either acquires, or succeeds to a great fortune, does not necessarily acquire or succeed to any political power, either civil or military. His fortune may, perhaps, afford him the means of acquiring both; but the mere possession of that fortune does not necessarily convey to him either. The power which that possession immediately and directly conveys to him, is the power of purchasing a certain command over all the labour, or over all the produce of labour which is then in the market.', 'His fortune is greater or less, precisely in proportion to the extent of this power, or to the quantity either of other menâ\\x80\\x99s labour, or, what is the same thing, of the produce of other menâ\\x80\\x99s labour, which it enables him to purchase or command. The exchangeable value of every thing must always be precisely equal to the extent of this power which it conveys to its owner. </p> <p> But though labour be the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities, it is not that by which their value is commonly estimated. It is often difficult to ascertain the proportion between two different quantities of labour. The time spent in two different sorts of work will not always alone determine this proportion. The different degrees of hardship endured, and of ingenuity exercised, must likewise be taken into account. There may be more labour in an hourâ\\x80\\x99s hard work, than in two hours easy business; or in an hourâ\\x80\\x99s application to a trade which it cost ten years labour to learn, than in a monthâ\\x80\\x99s industry, at an ordinary and obvious employment. But it is not easy to find any accurate measure either of hardship or ingenuity. In exchanging, indeed, the different productions of different sorts of labour for one another, some allowance is commonly made for both. It is adjusted, however, not by any accurate measure, but by the higgling and bargaining of the market, according to that sort of rough equality which, though not exact, is sufficient for carrying on the business of common life. </p> <p> Every commodity, besides, is more frequently exchanged for, and thereby compared with, other commodities, than with labour. It is more natural, therefore, to estimate its exchangeable value by the quantity of some other commodity, than by that of the labour which it can produce. The greater part of people, too, understand better what is meant by a quantity of a particular commodity, than by a quantity of labour. The one is a plain palpable object; the other an abstract notion, which though it can be made sufficiently intelligible, is not altogether so natural and obvious. </p> <p> But when barter ceases, and money has become the common instrument of commerce, every particular commodity is more frequently exchanged for money than for any other commodity.']\n",

Since the down-fall of the Roman empire, the policy of Europe has been more favourable to arts, manufactures, and commerce, the industry of towns, than to agriculture, the Industry of the country.', 'In this book I have endeavoured to shew, first, what are the necessary expenses of the sovereign, or commonwealth; which of those expenses ought to be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society, and which of them, by that of some particular part only, or of some particular members of it: secondly, what are the different methods in which the whole society may be made to contribute towards defraying the expenses incumbent on the whole society, and what are the principal advantages and inconveniencies of each of those methods; and, thirdly and lastly, what are the reasons and causes which have induced almost all modern governments to mortgage some part of this revenue, or to contract debts; and what have been the effects of those debts upon the real wealth, the annual produce of the land and labour of the society. </p> </div><!--end chapter--> <div class=\"chapter\"> <h2><a id=\"chap02\"></a>BOOK I.<br> OF THE CAUSES OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE PRODUCTIVE POWERS OF LABOUR, AND OF THE ORDER ACCORDING TO WHICH ITS PRODUCE IS NATURALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE DIFFERENT RANKS OF THE PEOPLE.</h2> </div><!--end chapter--> <div class=\"chapter\"> <h2><a id=\"chap03\"></a>CHAPTER I.<br> OF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.</h2> <p> The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour. The effects of the division of labour, in the general business of society, will be more easily understood, by considering in what manner it operates in some particular manufactures.', 'The consumption is the same, but the consumers are different. </p> <p> By what a frugal man annually saves, he not only affords maintenance to an additional number of productive hands, for that of the ensuing year, but like the founder of a public work-house he establishes, as it were, a perpetual fund for the maintenance of an equal number in all times to come. The perpetual allotment and destination of this fund, indeed, is not always guarded by any positive law, by any trust-right or deed of mortmain. It is always guarded, however, by a very powerful principle, the plain and evident interest of every individual to whom any share of it shall ever belong. No part of it can ever afterwards be employed to maintain any but productive hands, without an evident loss to the person who thus perverts it from its proper destination. </p> <p> The prodigal perverts it in this manner: By not confining his expense within his income, he encroaches upon his capital. Like him who perverts the revenues of some pious foundation to profane purposes, he pays the wages of idleness with those funds which the frugality of his forefathers had, as it were, consecrated to the maintenance of industry. By diminishing the funds destined for the employment of productive labour, he necessarily diminishes, so far as it depends upon him, the quantity of that labour which adds a value to the subject upon which it is bestowed, and, consequently, the value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the whole country, the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants. If the prodigality of some were not compensated by the frugality of others, the conduct of every prodigal, by feeding the idle with the bread of the industrious, would tend not only to beggar himself, but to impoverish his country. </p> <p> Though the expense of the prodigal should be altogether in home made, and no part of it in foreign commodities, its effect upon the productive funds of the society would still be the same. Every year there would still be a certain quantity of food and clothing, which ought to have maintained productive, employed in maintaining unproductive hands.']\n",

That destined for performing the same office with regard to the freeman is managed by the freeman himself. The disorders which generally prevail in the economy of the rich, naturally introduce themselves into the management of the former; the strict frugality and parsimonious attention of the poor as naturally establish themselves in that of the latter. Under such different management, the same purpose must require very different degrees of expense to execute it. It appears, accordingly, from the experience of all ages and nations, I believe, that the work done by freemen comes cheaper in the end than that performed by slaves. It is found to do so even at Boston, New-York, and Philadelphia, where the wages of common labour are so very high. </p> <p> The liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the effect of increasing wealth, so it is the cause of increasing population. To complain of it, is to lament over the necessary cause and effect of the greatest public prosperity. </p> <p> It deserves to be remarked, perhaps, that it is in the progressive state, while the society is advancing to the further acquisition, rather than when it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the condition of the labouring poor, of the great body of the people, seems to be the happiest and the most comfortable. It is hard in the stationary, and miserable in the declining state. The progressive state is, in reality, the cheerful and the hearty state to all the different orders of the society; the stationary is dull; the declining melancholy. </p> <p> The liberal reward of labour, as it encourages the propagation, so it increases the industry of the common people. The wages of labour are the encouragement of industry, which, like every other human quality, improves in proportion to the encouragement it receives. A plentiful subsistence increases the bodily strength of the labourer, and the comfortable hope of bettering his condition, and of ending his days, perhaps, in ease and plenty, animates him to exert that strength to the utmost. Where wages are high, accordingly, we shall always find the workmen more active, diligent, and expeditious, than where they are low; in England, for example, than in Scotland; in the neighbourhood of great towns, than in remote country places.', 'In the attacks which those leading men are continually making upon the importance of one another, and in the defence of their own, consists the whole play of domestic faction and ambition. The leading men of America, like those of all other countries, desire to preserve their own importance. They feel, or imagine, that if their assemblies, which they are fond of calling parliaments, and of considering as equal in authority to the parliament of Great Britain, should be so far degraded as to become the humble ministers and executive officers of that parliament, the greater part of their own importance would be at an end. They have rejected, therefore, the proposal of being taxed by parliamentary requisition, and, like other ambitious and high-spirited men, have rather chosen to draw the sword in defence of their own importance. </p> <p> Towards the declension of the Roman republic, the allies of Rome, who had borne the principal burden of defending the state and extending the empire, demanded to be admitted to all the privileges of Roman citizens. Upon being refused, the social war broke out. During the course of that war, Rome granted those privileges to the greater part of them, one by one, and in proportion as they detached themselves from the general confederacy. The parliament of Great Britain insists upon taxing the colonies; and they refuse to be taxed by a parliament in which they are not represented. If to each colony which should detach itself from the general confederacy, Great Britain should allow such a number of representatives as suited the proportion of what it contributed to the public revenue of the empire, in consequence of its being subjected to the same taxes, and in compensation admitted to the same freedom of trade with its fellow-subjects at home; the number of its representatives to be augmented as the proportion of its contribution might afterwards augment; a new method of acquiring importance, a new and more dazzling object of ambition, would be presented to the leading men of each colony. Instead of piddling for the little prizes which are to be found in what may be called the paltry raffle of colony faction, they might then hope, from the presumption which men naturally have in their own ability and good fortune, to draw some of the great prizes which sometimes come from the wheel of the great state lottery of British politics.', 'There is, upon this account, little variety in the greater part of their works. The most distinct and best connected account of this doctrine is to be found in a little book written by Mr. Mercier de la Riviere, some time intendant of Martinico, entitled, The natural and essential Order of Political Societies. The admiration of this whole sect for their master, who was himself a man of the greatest modesty and simplicity, is not inferior to that of any of the ancient philosophers for the founders of their respective systems. â\\x80\\x98There have been since the world began,â\\x80\\x99 says a very diligent and respectable author, the Marquis de Mirabeau, â\\x80\\x98three great inventions which have principally given stability to political societies, independent of many other inventions which have enriched and adorned them. The first is the invention of writing, which alone gives human nature the power of transmitting, without alteration, its laws, its contracts, its annals, and its discoveries. The second is the invention of money, which binds together all the relations between civilized societies. The third is the economical table, the result of the other two, which completes them both by perfecting their object; the great discovery of our age, but of which our posterity will reap the benefit.â\\x80\\x99 </p> <p> As the political economy of the nations of modern Europe has been more favourable to manufactures and foreign trade, the industry of the towns, than to agriculture, the industry of the country; so that of other nations has followed a different plan, and has been more favourable to agriculture than to manufactures and foreign trade. </p> <p> The policy of China favours agriculture more than all other employments. In China, the condition of a labourer is said to be as much superior to that of an artificer, as in most parts of Europe that of an artificer is to that of a labourer. In China, the great ambition of every man is to get possession of a little bit of land, either in property or in lease; and leases are there said to be granted upon very moderate terms, and to be sufficiently secured to the lessees. The Chinese have little respect for foreign trade. Your beggarly commerce! was the language in which the mandarins of Pekin used to talk to Mr. De Lange, the Russian envoy, concerning it {See the Journal of Mr. De Lange, in Bellâ\\x80\\x99s Travels, vol. ii. p.']\n",

Hence the exorbitant price of the necessaries of life during the blockade of a town, or in a famine. </p> <p> When the quantity brought to market exceeds the effectual demand, it cannot be all sold to those who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it thither. Some part must be sold to those who are willing to pay less, and the low price which they give for it must reduce the price of the whole. The market price will sink more or less below the natural price, according as the greatness of the excess increases more or less the competition of the sellers, or according as it happens to be more or less important to them to get immediately rid of the commodity. The same excess in the importation of perishable, will occasion a much greater competition than in that of durable commodities; in the importation of oranges, for example, than in that of old iron. </p> <p> When the quantity brought to market is just sufficient to supply the effectual demand, and no more, the market price naturally comes to be either exactly, or as nearly as can be judged of, the same with the natural price. The whole quantity upon hand can be disposed of for this price, and can not be disposed of for more. The competition of the different dealers obliges them all to accept of this price, but does not oblige them to accept of less. </p> <p> The quantity of every commodity brought to market naturally suits itself to the effectual demand. It is the interest of all those who employ their land, labour, or stock, in bringing any commodity to market, that the quantity never should exceed the effectual demand; and it is the interest of all other people that it never should fall short of that demand. </p> <p> If at any time it exceeds the effectual demand, some of the component parts of its price must be paid below their natural rate.', 'If it is rent, the interest of the landlords will immediately prompt them to withdraw a part of their land; and if it is wages or profit, the interest of the labourers in the one case, and of their employers in the other, will prompt them to withdraw a part of their labour or stock, from this employment. The quantity brought to market will soon be no more than sufficient to supply the effectual demand. All the different parts of its price will rise to their natural rate, and the whole price to its natural price. </p> <p> If, on the contrary, the quantity brought to market should at any time fall short of the effectual demand, some of the component parts of its price must rise above their natural rate. If it is rent, the interest of all other landlords will naturally prompt them to prepare more land for the raising of this commodity; if it is wages or profit, the interest of all other labourers and dealers will soon prompt them to employ more labour and stock in preparing and bringing it to market. The quantity brought thither will soon be sufficient to supply the effectual demand. All the different parts of its price will soon sink to their natural rate, and the whole price to its natural price. </p> <p> The natural price, therefore, is, as it were, the central price, to which the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating. Different accidents may sometimes keep them suspended a good deal above it, and sometimes force them down even somewhat below it. But whatever may be the obstacles which hinder them from settling in this centre of repose and continuance, they are constantly tending towards it. </p> <p> The whole quantity of industry annually employed in order to bring any commodity to market, naturally suits itself in this manner to the effectual demand. It naturally aims at bringing always that precise quantity thither which may be sufficient to supply, and no more than supply, that demand. </p> <p> But, in some employments, the same quantity of industry will, in different years, produce very different quantities of commodities; while, in others, it will produce always the same, or very nearly the same.

The effects of the division of labour, in the general business of society, will be more easily understood, by considering in what manner it operates in some particular manufactures.', 'I have seen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations. </p> <p> In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour are similar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so great a simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labour. The separation of different trades and employments from one another, seems to have taken place in consequence of this advantage. This separation, too, is generally carried furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society, being generally that of several in an improved one. In every improved society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer; the manufacturer, nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is necessary to produce any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided among a great number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each branch of the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and dressers of the cloth!']\n",

It is impossible to separate so entirely the business of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the sower of the seed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the same. The occasions for those different sorts of labour returning with the different seasons of the year, it is impossible that one man should be constantly employed in any one of them. This impossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the different branches of labour employed in agriculture, is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the productive powers of labour, in this art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. The most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly more distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their lands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense bestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural fertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much more than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always much more productive than that of the poor; or, at least, it is never so much more productive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich country, therefore, will not always, in the same degree of goodness, come cheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the same degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France, notwithstanding the superior opulence and improvement of the latter country. The corn of France is, in the corn-provinces, fully as good, and in most years nearly about the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and improvement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of England, however, are better cultivated than those of France, and the corn-lands of France are said to be much better cultivated than those of Poland.', 'Had human institutions, therefore, never disturbed the natural course of things, the progressive wealth and increase of the towns would, in every political society, be consequential, and in proportion to the improvement and cultivation of the territory of country. </p> <p> In our North American colonies, where uncultivated land is still to be had upon easy terms, no manufactures for distant sale have ever yet been established in any of their towns. When an artificer has acquired a little more stock than is necessary for carrying on his own business in supplying the neighbouring country, he does not, in North America, attempt to establish with it a manufacture for more distant sale, but employs it in the purchase and improvement of uncultivated land. From artificer he becomes planter; and neither the large wages nor the easy subsistence which that country affords to artificers, can bribe him rather to work for other people than for himself. He feels that an artificer is the servant of his customers, from whom he derives his subsistence; but that a planter who cultivates his own land, and derives his necessary subsistence from the labour of his own family, is really a master, and independent of all the world. </p> <p> In countries, on the contrary, where there is either no uncultivated land, or none that can be had upon easy terms, every artificer who has acquired more stock than he can employ in the occasional jobs of the neighbourhood, endeavours to prepare work for more distant sale. The smith erects some sort of iron, the weaver some sort of linen or woollen manufactory. Those different manufactures come, in process of time, to be gradually subdivided, and thereby improved and refined in a great variety of ways, which may easily be conceived, and which it is therefore unnecessary to explain any farther. </p> <p> In seeking for employment to a capital, manufactures are, upon equal or nearly equal profits, naturally preferred to foreign commerce, for the same reason that agriculture is naturally preferred to manufactures. As the capital of the landlord or farmer is more secure than that of the manufacturer, so the capital of the manufacturer, being at all times more within his view and command, is more secure than that of the foreign merchant.', 'That which arises from the more solid improvements of agriculture is much more durable, and cannot be destroyed but by those more violent convulsions occasioned by the depredations of hostile and barbarous nations continued for a century or two together; such as those that happened for some time before and after the fall of the Roman empire in the western provinces of Europe. </p> </div><!--end chapter--> <div class=\"chapter\"> <h2><a id=\"chap25\"></a>BOOK IV.<br> OF SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY.</h2> <p> Political economy, considered as a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator, proposes two distinct objects; first, to provide a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people, or, more properly, to enable them to provide such a revenue or subsistence for themselves; and, secondly, to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue sufficient for the public services. It proposes to enrich both the people and the sovereign. </p> <p> The different progress of opulence in different ages and nations, has given occasion to two different systems of political economy, with regard to enriching the people. The one may be called the system of commerce, the other that of agriculture. I shall endeavour to explain both as fully and distinctly as I can, and shall begin with the system of commerce.

In consequence of its being the instrument of commerce, when we have money we can more readily obtain whatever else we have occasion for, than by means of any other commodity. The great affair, we always find, is to get money. When that is obtained, there is no difficulty in making any subsequent purchase.

But whether the capital which carries this surplus produce abroad be a foreign or a domestic one, is of very little importance. If the society has not acquired sufficient capital, both to cultivate all its lands, and to manufacture in the completest manner the whole of its rude produce, there is even a considerable advantage that the rude produce should be exported by a foreign capital, in order that the whole stock of the society may be employed in more useful purposes. The wealth of ancient Egypt, that of China and Indostan, sufficiently demonstrate that a nation may attain a very high degree of opulence, though the greater part of its exportation trade be carried on by foreigners. The progress of our North American and West Indian colonies, would have been much less rapid, had no capital but what belonged to themselves been employed in exporting their surplus produce. </p> <p> According to the natural course of things, therefore, the greater part of the capital of every growing society is, first, directed to agriculture, afterwards to manufactures, and, last of all, to foreign commerce. This order of things is so very natural, that in every society that had any territory, it has always, I believe, been in some degree observed. Some of their lands must have been cultivated before any considerable towns could be established, and some sort of coarse industry of the manufacturing kind must have been carried on in those towns, before they could well think of employing themselves in foreign commerce. </p> <p> But though this natural order of things must have taken place in some degree in every such society, it has, in all the modern states of Europe, been in many respects entirely inverted. The foreign commerce of some of their cities has introduced all their finer manufactures, or such as were fit for distant sale; and manufactures and foreign commerce together have given birth to the principal improvements of agriculture.', 'It then became necessary to say something about the beneficial effects of foreign trade, and the manner in which those effects were obstructed by the laws as they then stood. To the judges who were to decide the business, it appeared a most satisfactory account of the matter, when they were told that foreign trade brought money into the country, but that the laws in question hindered it from bringing so much as it otherwise would do. Those arguments, therefore, produced the wished-for effect. The prohibition of exporting gold and silver was, in France and England, confined to the coin of those respective countries. The exportation of foreign coin and of bullion was made free. In Holland, and in some other places, this liberty was extended even to the coin of the country. The attention of government was turned away from guarding against the exportation of gold and silver, to watch over the balance of trade, as the only cause which could occasion any augmentation or diminution of those metals. From one fruitless care, it was turned away to another care much more intricate, much more embarrassing, and just equally fruitless. The title of Munâ\\x80\\x99s book, Englandâ\\x80\\x99s Treasure in Foreign Trade, became a fundamental maxim in the political economy, not of England only, but of all other commercial countries. The inland or home trade, the most important of all, the trade in which an equal capital affords the greatest revenue, and creates the greatest employment to the people of the country, was considered as subsidiary only to foreign trade. It neither brought money into the country, it was said, nor carried any out of it. The country, therefore, could never become either richer or poorer by means of it, except so far as its prosperity or decay might indirectly influence the state of foreign trade. </p> <p> A country that has no mines of its own, must undoubtedly draw its gold and silver from foreign countries, in the same manner as one that has no vineyards of its own must draw its wines. It does not seem necessary, however, that the attention of government should be more turned towards the one than towards the other object. A country that has wherewithal to buy wine, will always get the wine which it has occasion for; and a country that has wherewithal to buy gold and silver, will never be in want of those metals.', 'They naturally, perhaps necessarily, follow the mode of the times; and their expense comes to be regulated by the same extravagant vanity which directs that of all the other great proprietors in their dominions. The insignificant pageantry of their court becomes every day more brilliant; and the expense of it not only prevents accumulation, but frequently encroaches upon the funds destined for more necessary expenses. What Dercyllidas said of the court of Persia, may be applied to that of several European princes, that he saw there much splendour, but little strength, and many servants, but few soldiers. </p> <p> The importation of gold and silver is not the principal, much less the sole benefit, which a nation derives from its foreign trade. Between whatever places foreign trade is carried on, they all of them derive two distinct benefits from it. It carries out that surplus part of the produce of their land and labour for which there is no demand among them, and brings back in return for it something else for which there is a demand. It gives a value to their superfluities, by exchanging them for something else, which may satisfy a part of their wants and increase their enjoyments. By means of it, the narrowness of the home market does not hinder the division of labour in any particular branch of art or manufacture from being carried to the highest perfection. By opening a more extensive market for whatever part of the produce of their labour may exceed the home consumption, it encourages them to improve its productive power, and to augment its annual produce to the utmost, and thereby to increase the real revenue and wealth of the society. These great and important services foreign trade is continually occupied in performing to all the different countries between which it is carried on. They all derive great benefit from it, though that in which the merchant resides generally derives the greatest, as he is generally more employed in supplying the wants, and carrying out the superfluities of his own, than of any other particular country. To import the gold and silver which may be wanted into the countries which have no mines, is, no doubt a part of the business of foreign commerce. It is, however, a most insignificant part of it. A country which carried on foreign trade merely upon this account, could scarce have occasion to freight a ship in a century. </p> <p> It is not by the importation of gold and silver that the discovery of America has enriched Europe. By the abundance of the American mines, those metals have become cheaper.']\n",

The number of useful and productive labourers, it will hereafter appear, is everywhere in proportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in setting them to work, and to the particular way in which it is so employed. The second book, therefore, treats of the nature of capital stock, of the manner in which it is gradually accumulated, and of the different quantities of labour which it puts into motion, according to the different ways in which it is employed. </p> <p> Nations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity, and judgment, in the application of labour, have followed very different plans in the general conduct or direction of it; and those plans have not all been equally favourable to the greatness of its produce. The policy of some nations has given extraordinary encouragement to the industry of the country; that of others to the industry of towns. Scarce any nation has dealt equally and impartially with every sort of industry. Since the down-fall of the Roman empire, the policy of Europe has been more favourable to arts, manufactures, and commerce, the industry of towns, than to agriculture, the Industry of the country.', 'In the first chapter, I have endeavoured to shew what are the different parts or branches into which the stock, either of an individual, or of a great society, naturally divides itself. In the second, I have endeavoured to explain the nature and operation of money, considered as a particular branch of the general stock of the society. The stock which is accumulated into a capital, may either be employed by the person to whom it belongs, or it may be lent to some other person. In the third and fourth chapters, I have endeavoured to examine the manner in which it operates in both these situations. The fifth and last chapter treats of the different effects which the different employments of capital immediately produce upon the quantity, both of national industry, and of the annual produce of land and labour. </p> </div><!--end chapter--> <div class=\"chapter\"> <h2><a id=\"chap15\"></a>CHAPTER I.<br> OF THE DIVISION OF STOCK.</h2> <p> When the stock which a man possesses is no more than sufficient to maintain him for a few days or a few weeks, he seldom thinks of deriving any revenue from it. He consumes it as sparingly as he can, and endeavours, by his labour, to acquire something which may supply its place before it be consumed altogether. His revenue is, in this case, derived from his labour only. This is the state of the greater part of the labouring poor in all countries. </p> <p> But when he possesses stock sufficient to maintain him for months or years, he naturally endeavours to derive a revenue from the greater part of it, reserving only so much for his immediate consumption as may maintain him till this revenue begins to come in. His whole stock, therefore, is distinguished into two parts. That part which he expects is to afford him this revenue is called his capital. The other is that which supplies his immediate consumption, and which consists either, first, in that portion of his whole stock which was originally reserved for this purpose; or, secondly, in his revenue, from whatever source derived, as it gradually comes in; or, thirdly, in such things as had been purchased by either of these in former years, and which are not yet entirely consumed, such as a stock of clothes, household furniture, and the like.', 'All useful machines and instruments of trade are originally derived from a circulating capital, which furnishes the materials of which they are made, and the maintenance of the workmen who make them. They require, too, a capital of the same kind to keep them in constant repair. </p> <p> No fixed capital can yield any revenue but by means of a circulating capital. The most useful machines and instruments of trade will produce nothing, without the circulating capital, which affords the materials they are employed upon, and the maintenance of the workmen who employ them. Land, however improved, will yield no revenue without a circulating capital, which maintains the labourers who cultivate and collect its produce. </p> <p> To maintain and augment the stock which may be reserved for immediate consumption, is the sole end and purpose both of the fixed and circulating capitals. It is this stock which feeds, clothes, and lodges the people. Their riches or poverty depend upon the abundant or sparing supplies which those two capitals can afford to the stock reserved for immediate consumption. </p> <p> So great a part of the circulating capital being continually withdrawn from it, in order to be placed in the other two branches of the general stock of the society, it must in its turn require continual supplies without which it would soon cease to exist. These supplies are principally drawn from three sources; the produce of land, of mines, and of fisheries. These afford continual supplies of provisions and materials, of which part is afterwards wrought up into finished work and by which are replaced the provisions, materials, and finished work, continually withdrawn from the circulating capital. From mines, too, is drawn what is necessary for maintaining and augmenting that part of it which consists in money. For though, in the ordinary course of business, this part is not, like the other three, necessarily withdrawn from it, in order to be placed in the other two branches of the general stock of the society, it must, however, like all other things, be wasted and worn out at last, and sometimes, too, be either lost or sent abroad, and must, therefore, require continual, though no doubt much smaller supplies. </p> <p> Land, mines, and fisheries, require all both a fixed and circulating capital to cultivate them; and their produce replaces, with a profit not only those capitals, but all the others in the society.']\n",

I shall consider each of them in a particular chapter, and, without taking much farther notice of their supposed tendency to bring money into the country, I shall examine chiefly what are likely to be the effects of each of them upon the annual produce of its industry.

Thus the prohibition of importing either live cattle or salt provisions from foreign countries, secures to the graziers of Great Britain the monopoly of the home market for butcherâ\\x80\\x99s meat.', 'Taxes imposed with a view to prevent, or even to diminish importation, are evidently as destructive of the revenue of the customs as of the freedom of trade. </p> </div><!--end chapter--> <div class=\"chapter\"> <h2><a id=\"chap28\"></a>CHAPTER III.<br> OF THE EXTRAORDINARY RESTRAINTS UPON THE IMPORTATION OF GOODS OF ALMOST ALL KINDS, FROM THOSE COUNTRIES WITH WHICH THE BALANCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE DISADVANTAGEOUS.</h2> <h3>Part Iâ\\x80\\x94Of the Unreasonableness of those Restraints, even upon the Principles of the Commercial System.</h3> <p> To lay extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods of almost all kinds, from those particular countries with which the balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous, is the second expedient by which the commercial system proposes to increase the quantity of gold and silver. Thus, in Great Britain, Silesia lawns may be imported for home consumption, upon paying certain duties; but French cambrics and lawns are prohibited to be imported, except into the port of London, there to be warehoused for exportation. Higher duties are imposed upon the wines of France than upon those of Portugal, or indeed of any other country. By what is called the impost 1692, a duty of five and-twenty per cent. of the rate or value, was laid upon all French goods; while the goods of other nations were, the greater part of them, subjected to much lighter duties, seldom exceeding five per cent. The wine, brandy, salt, and vinegar of France, were indeed excepted; these commodities being subjected to other heavy duties, either by other laws, or by particular clauses of the same law. In 1696, a second duty of twenty-five per cent. the first not having been thought a sufficient discouragement, was imposed upon all French goods, except brandy; together with a new duty of five-and-twenty pounds upon the ton of French wine, and another of fifteen pounds upon the ton of French vinegar. French goods have never been omitted in any of those general subsidies or duties of five per cent. which have been imposed upon all, or the greater part, of the goods enumerated in the book of rates.', 'It may perhaps in due time prepare the way for a better. </p> </div><!--end chapter--> <div class=\"chapter\"> <h2><a id=\"chap31\"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br> OF TREATIES OF COMMERCE.</h2> <p> When a nation binds itself by treaty, either to permit the entry of certain goods from one foreign country which it prohibits from all others, or to exempt the goods of one country from duties to which it subjects those of all others, the country, or at least the merchants and manufacturers of the country, whose commerce is so favoured, must necessarily derive great advantage from the treaty. Those merchants and manufacturers enjoy a sort of monopoly in the country which is so indulgent to them. That country becomes a market, both more extensive and more advantageous for their goods: more extensive, because the goods of other nations being either excluded or subjected to heavier duties, it takes off a greater quantity of theirs; more advantageous, because the merchants of the favoured country, enjoying a sort of monopoly there, will often sell their goods for a better price than if exposed to the free competition of all other nations. </p> <p> Such treaties, however, though they may be advantageous to the merchants and manufacturers of the favoured, are necessarily disadvantageous to those of the favouring country. A monopoly is thus granted against them to a foreign nation; and they must frequently buy the foreign goods they have occasion for, dearer than if the free competition of other nations was admitted. That part of its own produce with which such a nation purchases foreign goods, must consequently be sold cheaper; because, when two things are exchanged for one another, the cheapness of the one is a necessary consequence, or rather is the same thing, with the dearness of the other. The exchangeable value of its annual produce, therefore, is likely to be diminished by every such treaty. This diminution, however, can scarce amount to any positive loss, but only to a lessening of the gain which it might otherwise make. Though it sells its goods cheaper than it otherwise might do, it will not probably sell them for less than they cost; nor, as in the case of bounties, for a price which will not replace the capital employed in bringing them to market, together with the ordinary profits of stock.

Every man endeavours to supply, by his own industry, his own occasional wants, as they occur. When he is hungry, he goes to the forest to hunt; when his coat is worn out, he clothes himself with the skin of the first large animal he kills: and when his hut begins to go to ruin, he repairs it, as well as he can, with the trees and the turf that are nearest it. </p> <p> But when the division of labour has once been thoroughly introduced, the produce of a manâ\\x80\\x99s own labour can supply but a very small part of his occasional wants. The far greater part of them are supplied by the produce of other menâ\\x80\\x99s labour, which he purchases with the produce, or, what is the same thing, with the price of the produce, of his own. But this purchase cannot be made till such time as the produce of his own labour has not only been completed, but sold. A stock of goods of different kinds, therefore, must be stored up somewhere, sufficient to maintain him, and to supply him with the materials and tools of his work, till such time at least as both these events can be brought about. A weaver cannot apply himself entirely to his peculiar business, unless there is before-hand stored up somewhere, either in his own possession, or in that of some other person, a stock sufficient to maintain him, and to supply him with the materials and tools of his work, till he has not only completed, but sold his web.', 'The statesman, who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it. </p> <p> To give the monopoly of the home market to the produce of domestic industry, in any particular art or manufacture, is in some measure to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, and must in almost all cases be either a useless or a hurtful regulation. If the produce of domestic can be brought there as cheap as that of foreign industry, the regulation is evidently useless. If it cannot, it must generally be hurtful. It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes, but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one nor the other, but employs those different artificers. All of them find it for their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they have some advantage over their neighbours, and to purchase with a part of its produce, or, what is the same thing, with the price of a part of it, whatever else they have occasion for. </p> <p> What is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage. The general industry of the country being always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby be diminished, no more than that of the abovementioned artificers; but only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greatest advantage. It is certainly not employed to the greatest advantage, when it is thus directed towards an object which it can buy cheaper than it can make.']\n",

Holland is the country in Europe in which they abound most, and which, from peculiar circumstances, continues to prosper, not by means of them, as has been most absurdly supposed, but in spite of them. </p> <p> As there are two cases in which it will generally be advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry, so there are two others in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation, in the one, how far it is proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods; and, in the other, how far, or in what manner, it may be proper to restore that free importation, after it has been for some time interrupted. </p> <p> The case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation how far it is proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods, is when some foreign nation restrains, by high duties or prohibitions, the importation of some of our manufactures into their country. Revenge, in this case, naturally dictates retaliation, and that we should impose the like duties and prohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their manufactures into ours. Nations, accordingly, seldom fail to retaliate in this manner. The French have been particularly forward to favour their own manufactures, by restraining the importation of such foreign goods as could come into competition with them. In this consisted a great part of the policy of Mr Colbert, who, notwithstanding his great abilities, seems in this case to have been imposed upon by the sophistry of merchants and manufacturers, who are always demanding a monopoly against their countrymen. It is at present the opinion of the most intelligent men in France, that his operations of this kind have not been beneficial to his country. That minister, by the tariff of 1667, imposed very high duties upon a great number of foreign manufactures. Upon his refusing to moderate them in favour of the Dutch, they, in 1671, prohibited the importation of the wines, brandies, and manufactures of France. The war of 1672 seems to have been in part occasioned by this commercial dispute.', 'But that trade which, without force or constraint, is naturally and regularly carried on between any two places, is always advantageous, though not always equally so, to both. </p> <p> By advantage or gain, I understand, not the increase of the quantity of gold and silver, but that of the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, or the increase of the annual revenue of its inhabitants. </p> <p> If the balance be even, and if the trade between the two places consist altogether in the exchange of their native commodities, they will, upon most occasions, not only both gain, but they will gain equally, or very nearly equally; each will, in this case, afford a market for a part of the surplus produce of the other; each will replace a capital which had been employed in raising and preparing for the market this part of the surplus produce of the other, and which had been distributed among, and given revenue and maintenance to, a certain number of its inhabitants. Some part of the inhabitants of each, therefore, will directly derive their revenue and maintenance from the other. As the commodities exchanged, too, are supposed to be of equal value, so the two capitals employed in the trade will, upon most occasions, be equal, or very nearly equal; and both being employed in raising the native commodities of the two countries, the revenue and maintenance which their distribution will afford to the inhabitants of each will be equal, or very nearly equal. This revenue and maintenance, thus mutually afforded, will be greater or smaller, in proportion to the extent of their dealings. If these should annually amount to Â£100,000, for example, or to Â£1,000,000, on each side, each of them will afford an annual revenue, in the one case, of Â£100,000, and, in the other, of Â£1,000,000, to the inhabitants of the other. </p> <p> If their trade should be of such a nature, that one of them exported to the other nothing but native commodities, while the returns of that other consisted altogether in foreign goods; the balance, in this case, would still be supposed even, commodities being paid for with commodities. They would, in this case too, both gain, but they would not gain equally; and the inhabitants of the country which exported nothing but native commodities, would derive the greatest revenue from the trade.']\n",
